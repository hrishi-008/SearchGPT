The top smartwatches around today connect to your smartphone in order to deliver notifications to your wrist, as well as give you quick and easy access to a range of apps, like meditation apps, timers, weather insights, and so much more.Whether you need a workout companion or simply want a stylish-looking watch with some extra features, a smartwatch is a great piece of tech to invest in, the good news is that these days there\u2019s a lot of choice \u2013 even a sold selection of cheap smartwatches if you\u2019re on a budget.We've tested and reviewed many smartwatches, including the most popular and high-end entries, like the latest Apple Watch models, including the Series 9 and Ultra 2, and Samsung smartwatches.

It's bigger and bulkier, than the standard Apple Watch, and has a faster S9 processor, enabling that excellent Double Tap gesture available on the Series 9 below. In all other respects, it's identical to its predecessor, the original Apple Watch Ultra. It could still offer better battery life (despite surpassing the regular Apple Watch) but a powerful and accurate GPS is great for exploring, especially with watchOS 10's improved hiking waypoints feature, plus it's a working dive computer with the Oceanic Plus app. During testing, we easily found this to be the most capable wearable that the brand has ever made. Unfortunately, it is limited by its reliance on Apple phones, and its high price. However, when looking at the smartwatches on this list in a vacuum, it is the best smartwatch from a technical standpoint. As you can see in the specs table below, it's got the biggest, brightest screen, it can dive the deepest underwater, and its case is comprised of ultra-hard titanium.

So it strikes a superb balance between price and performance, and is a great relatively affordable pick.Read our full Apple Watch SE 2 reviewThe best Samsung watch(Image credit: Future)Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra The best Samsung smartwatch overallOur expert review: SpecificationsOS: Wear OS (One UI Watch 6)Compatibility: AndroidDisplay: 480 x 480 px full-color AMOLEDProcessor: Exynos W1000Onboard storage: 32GBBattery duration: Up to 100 hoursCharging method: Qi wireless chargingIP rating: IP68 + 10ATMConnectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPSToday's Best DealsView at Currys(White)View at ArgosView at very.co.uk(Grey)Reasons to buy+Powerful fitness features+Durable and toughReasons to avoid-Relatively pricey-Optimized for Samsung phonesThe Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra is, from a technical standpoint is Samsung's biggest and best watch yet. It lasts longer, is more powerful, more durable, and is radically different in design to the other Samsung watches in its lineup. It's sat on a conspicuous titanium cushion, and offers powerful outdoor-focused features.A larger Super AMOLED display is sharp and clear, as well as able to handle very bright outdoor scenes. Performance-wise, it's fast although you'll reap the most benefits when paired with a Samsung smartphone. There's no iPhone support here either, but it's very much Samsung's version of Apple's successful Ultra line. Besides SmartThings integration, the highlights here is the updated chipset, the Exynos W1000, its durability, accurate GPS features, and Samsung's cool ability to monitor your body's muscle and fat composition. It's bordering on the ultimate fitness tool with extensive sleep tracking also helping you get the most from yourself every day, but we found it big and heavy to wear overnight during our tests.Read our full Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra reviewThe best Google watch (Image credit: Future)Google Pixel Watch 2 The best Google smartwatch for Pixel usersOur expert review: SpecificationsOS: Wear OS 4Compatibility: Android 8.0 or higherDisplay: 1.2\" OLEDProcessor: Qualcomm Snapdragon W5Onboard storage: 32GBBattery: 24 hoursCharging method: WirelessIP rating: Water-resistant to 5 ATMConnectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, LTEToday's Best DealsView at Currys(4-inch)View at John LewisView at Amazon(Silver)Reasons to buy+Elegant, classic watch-like looks+Brilliant screen+New multi-path HR sensorReasons to avoid-One (small) size fits all-Band switch system takes practice-No blood oxygen sensing - yetThe Google Pixel Watch 2, like its predecessor, is an uncommonly beautiful smartwatch. It has a natural rather than a manufactured look, with a glossy face that curves to meet an equally curvaceous body. The construction is close to seamless.Because of that curve, there's more glass facing you than on the Apple Watch Series 9, which both adds to the elegance and cunningly hides a larger-ish black bezel surrounding the screen. The battery life is slightly improved compared to the original, getting fast charge, while a new multi-path HR sensor improves workout tracking. This is a bright, colorful, and responsive AMOLED display, considerably smaller than the Apple Watch Series 9's rectangular face, but Google does a lot with the reduced screen real estate. We never found ourselves wishing for more, except for the battery life. Although it's an improvement over the original Pixel and most Apple offerings, it's still a continual frustration at 24 hours: less than the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6, and a bugbear we have with many watches on this list compared to, say, a Garmin.Read our full Google Pixel Watch 2 reviewThe best Android smartwatch(Image credit: Luke Baker)OnePlus Watch 2 The best Wear OS smartwatch not made by GoogleOur expert review: SpecificationsCompatibility: Android, iOSDisplay: 466 x 466px, AMOLEDProcessor: Snapdragon W5+, BES2700BPOnboard storage: 32GBBattery duration: Up to 100 hoursCharging method: Magnetic connecting pinIP rating: 5ATMConnectivity: Bluetooth 5.0 and BLEToday's Best DealsView at AmazonView at Amazon(Black)View at Amazon(32GB)Reasons to buy+Big battery life with dual OS+Accurate fitness metrics+Looks greatReasons to avoid-Single size-Rotating crown not usedThe OnePlus Watch 2 is an excellent all-rounder smartwatch, knocking the TicWatch Pro 5 from this place in the list, and an outstanding Pixel Watch alternative.It has a lot going for it. For one thing, it uses the mighty Snapdragon W5+ Gen1 processor, so performance is good, and it also runs a second operating system, which it switches to when needed, in order to prevent unnecessary battery drain. That's how it gets to its impressive 100-hour battery life: clever use of its dual chipset. It also offers very accurate fitness tracking metrics, which we tested during forest walks in Finland against the Garmin Epix Pro. It looks great on-wrist, too, with leather strap options, a design based on analogue chronographs, and a few cool color choices such as Nordic Blue.

It's got in-built GPS, up to 13 days of battery life, and in our review we mentioned the design was great, both in software and hardware. If you want a simplified smartwatch with a few health metrics, this is the one to get.The downsides? With that low price point, of course, comes some missing features. It's never going to be as stacked with third-party apps or as versatile as an Apple or Samsung Galaxy watch, and you have to go through the rigmarole of manually adding contacts before calling them on the watch. The OS is pretty minimal, as one might expect from Nothing.However, if you're looking for a cheap do-it-all watch that still looks attractive, you could certainly do a lot worse. The CMF Watch Pro is well-built, attractive and simple to use, and will certainly pick up a cult following. Read our full CMF Watch Pro by Nothing reviewHow to choose the best smartwatch for youUnfortunately, your choice of smartwatch often depends on your choice of phone, as not all wearables are compatible with competitor devices. Apple Watch only works with Apple iPhones. Samsung and Google watches, and other Wear OS devices, only work with Android devices, but you can use a Samsung watch with a Google phone and vice versa.Fitness tracking wearables from Fitbit will work with any device and synchronize with the Fitbit app, but those devices tend to focus more sharply on fitness features, and don't offer all of the robust apps and services you'll find on other smartwatches. Most wearables will get about a day of battery life, which will be disappointing if you're converting from a Garmin watch that lasts weeks. You can find a few watches that last longer on this list. Finally, smartwatches can be expensive, and frankly they don't offer much value for what you pay. Before you spring for an Apple Watch Ultra, you might ask if you are really going Scuba diving this year, or if you're just going to check your text messages without disturbing your dinner mates. Can you use Apple Watch with an Android phone?The first thing to check is whether your phone is compatible with the smartwatch you want. You can't use an Apple Watch with an Android phone, as all the functions of watchOS require iOS to interface with. You can use a Fitbit or Google Pixel Watch with an iPhone, but without Android or Google accounts, your experience will be sorely diminished. Samsung and Huawei also require handset-watch synergy to operate at their best. However, many devices like Garmin watches and the CMF Watch Pro by Nothing require nothing more than their own apps to work, meaning you can use them with either handset just fine. Which is the best smartwatch?The best smartwatch changes all the time, but typically you'll find an Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy smartwatch topping the list, as these tend to be packed full of high-end features and polish.How we test smartwatchesEvery smartwatch on this list has been fully and extensively reviewed by the expert team at TechRadar, so we know exactly what makes them tick.Our review process involves using the devices as if they were our own personal wearables, ensuring every smartwatch gets fully tested in the real world. A comprehensive sweep of features takes place, and usage is varied over a week to give us a clear idea of how battery life performs.When testing in-house, we generally look at how accurate the GPS is on each smartwatch by testing it against an industry leader such as the Garmin Epix Pro. Likewise for workout metrics. We also rank how usable the watch's operating system is, whether it supports third-party apps, and where it sits in the market. For example, a cheap watch with fewer features is more likely to get four stars than a feature-stuffed premium watch that isn't worth the expensive price. Using that knowledge we've then ranked them, factoring in their value, design, features and performance to get an overall star verdict.

Subscribe Today.Photograph: Julian ChokkattuBest for iPhone OwnersApple Watch Series 9The Apple Watch is the best smartwatch money can buy. It has the best operating system, WatchOS, with plenty of apps to help reduce the number of times you need to pull out your phone. The Series 9 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is nearly identical to its predecessor, the Series 8, but can process Siri requests on the device, making it snappier and more private (unless Siri needs to access the web for the answer). That means you can ask the voice assistant about your health data from the week prior and get results quickly. This is thanks to the S9 chip, which is more efficient and delivers slightly better battery life\u2014you'll still need to regularly recharge the watch. The most exciting new addition is Double Tap. You can tap two fingers together on your watch hand to accept or reject calls, reply to messages, start or end timers, and more. It's super handy.There's a new second-gen ultra-wideband chipset, which can help you precisely locate your iPhone at greater range. As usual, the health features remain robust. There's an FDA-cleared electrocardiogram sensor, plus you can measure oxygen saturation in the blood (SpO2)\u2014helpful for athletes training at altitude or anyone with an underlying health condition. However, this feature is no longer available in the US on Apple Watches sold after January 18, 2024, due to a patent dispute. Our Best Apple Watch guide has more details, and check out our Apple Watch Accessories guide for extras.Comes in 41-mm or 45-mm sizes.$399 at Amazon$399 at Best Buy$399 at Apple$400 at TargetPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuBest for Samsung OwnersSamsung Galaxy Watch7The Galaxy Watch7 is the latest iteration in Samsung's smartwatch lineup, and I really like the refined and simple rounded design\u2014the accented 20-mm straps add a nice touch, especially the green (though you can swap them if you want). The smartwatch experience gets more elevated every year, and this year's model infuses some artificial intelligence algorithms to improve your health tracking data, like the Energy Score and updated sleep tracking capabilities. The former gives you a nice number at the start of your day, and I found it helpful to dig through the data and see whether I should push myself or take a break. The sleep tracking offers a lot of information, but I did notice a few times when it had a gap in my data because it stopped tracking mid-sleep. You also get FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection, though this isn't a feature you'll turn on all the time\u2014it takes two nights to track and afterward, you'll get a note saying whether or not you show symptoms. It's worth noting that this feature, along with the electrocardiogram and irregular heart rhythm notifications, is only available when paired with a Samsung phone, but otherwise, this watch functions well with any other Android.There are two sizes you can choose from, and you can opt for a Bluetooth-only model or one with LTE. I tested both sizes and found battery life frustrating compared to older models. With the always-on display, I struggled to hit a full 24 hours with two tracked activities and sleep tracking overnight. With it turned off, things fared a little better, but I was still just barely hitting a full day. You'll have to baby the battery and utilize the power-saving modes when you can. The rest of the smartwatch is rich and feature-filled. It's dead simple to check notifications, respond to messages, and even control your smart home devices via SmartThings or Google Home. If you keep the charger handy, the Galaxy Watch7 is very nice companion.Watch7 comes in 40-mm or 44-mm sizes.$300 at Samsung$300 $279 at Amazon$300 at Best BuyPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuBest for Android OwnersGoogle Pixel Watch 2Note: Google is expected to announce the Pixel Watch 3 soon on August 13, so I recommend holding off until we see what's new. You'll likely see some steep discounts on the Pixel Watch 2.The original Pixel Watch was missing a lot of features when it launched, but Google slowly added them over a year. That means the Pixel Watch 2 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) has nearly everything you'd want. There's auto-start and auto-stop workout detection, fall detection, SpO2 measurements, and even a redesigned Fitbit app that looks much more modern. Google has even added Safety Check, allowing you to share your location with emergency contacts if you don't respond after a certain time. A Body Response feature can also detect good and bad stress and offer ways to cope, like with a guided breathing session. And newer updates since have added features like Car Crash Detection and Bicycle Fall Detection.This is easily still the prettiest smartwatch in my eyes, and it's super comfy on the wrist. It also nails its health and fitness features, from reliable heart rate and sleep-tracking data to an improved workout screen that shows you the most important information at a glance, including heart rate zones. You can take electrocardiograms and monitor for an irregular heart rate too. The battery life is unfortunately just OK\u2014it'll last about a day\u2014and this watch is also not repairable. If you have issues, you'll have to get a replacement under the one-year warranty. I also don't love that it has yet another proprietary charger that is different from the original Pixel Watch charger, though it does juice up the smartwatch quicker.Comes in a 41-mm size.$350 at Google Store$329 $247 at Amazon$350 at Best Buy$350 $290 at TargetPhotograph: GarminBest Fitness WatchGarmin Vivomove TrendFitness watches are typically not as sleek or simple to operate as more robust smartwatches, but the Vivomove Trend (8/10, WIRED Recommends) oozes elegance. This is also the first Garmin to include wireless charging, which means you\u2019re now free to ditch your annoying Garmin plug-in charger.The watch has it all\u2014wireless charging, blood oxygen measurements, sleep tracking, auto-activity tracking, and Garmin\u2019s proprietary and excellent algorithms for measuring your fitness. It\u2019s a little clunky to operate\u2014it's not anywhere near as feature-rich as the other smartwatches above\u2014but that might be OK if you prioritize battery life, as this tracker can last five days on a single charge. Read our Best Fitness Watches guide for more recommendations.Comes in a 40.4-mm size.$270 at Garmin$270 at Amazon$270 at Walmart$300 at Best BuyPhotograph: Adrienne SoBest Kids' WatchFitbit Ace LTEThere are a lot of poor-quality kids\u2019 smartwatches\u2014with potentially dangerous vulnerabilities. That's why we\u2019re a little more comfortable recommending the Fitbit Ace LTE (8/10, WIRED Recommends). Google-owned Fitbit promises not to store children's health data for research, and it will delete location history after 24 hours and all health data after 30 days. This watch requires a subscription to Fitbit Ace ($10 per month), but that includes cellular connectivity, so you don't need to add it to your carrier's cellular plan. You can set contacts and your kids can make phone calls and texts through the watch to the Fitbit Ace app, and they can share their location via Google Maps.Fitbit is bringing the gamified fitness tracking experience that adults are used to for kids with Fitbit Arcade, and there's even a Tamagotchi-like virtual character (Eejie) your kids can take care of. These games are time-based, so your kids can hit their activity goals by completing them, and the parental controls let you set limits, like School Time, which locks down many of the watch's features. It's a great way for your kid to go out and be independent, while also giving you the peace of mind in knowing how to reach and find them\u2014without the problems that come with giving them a smartphone at such a young age.Comes in a 40-mm size.\u2605 An alternative: The second-gen Apple Watch SE ($219) is a nice option for kids if you set it up for them via Apple's Family Setup. It doesn't come with fancy features like the electrocardiogram, the always-on display, or the skin temperature capabilities, though it does have fall detection. You can find your kids through Find My and message through the usual messaging apps, but the parental controls on the SE are not as robust.$230 at Google Store$222 at Amazon$230 at FitbitPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuBest Cheap SmartwatchCMF Watch Pro 2CMF is a sub-brand by Nothing, and its Watch Pro 2 is shockingly good value. It looks attractive (very minimalist!), and you can swap out the strap or even the bezel shape if you'd like. This is one of the rare sub-$100 smartwatches I like wearing that feels great on the wrist. So many of them look so bland and lack personality.It runs a proprietary operating system, but it works with both iPhones and Android devices. I've been able to view notifications from my phone (you can only respond to some with canned responses), and the heart rate and sleep tracking have been exceptionally accurate for a budget device, even if it takes a little longer to process and show you the results. My step count, however, has been considerably off compared to higher-end smartwatches. You can track exercises with it, and it even has GPS to provide mapping data, though the details are pretty basic and there's no additional context to the numbers. You can also control music playback, change watch faces (they're all very pretty on the AMOLED display), and check the weather. The app is slick, though I have noticed the watch tends to get disconnected, so some notifications don't come through all the time. Sometimes, the screen on the watch gets stuck on one screen and I have to press the crown to go back to the home screen. These are fairly minor quibbles, especially considering the excellent 10-day battery life I was able to hit. I went to Paris for a few days and came back, and I didn't even bring the charger. It's rare to find this kind of value for $69.Comes in a 33.5-mm size.$79 $69 at Amazon$69 at NothingPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuGreat Battery LifeOnePlus Watch 2 and Watch 2RThe OnePlus Watch 2 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is great for anyone with an Android phone looking for a Wear OS smartwatch that prioritizes battery life. It can last roughly three days on a single charge, a little more if you enable some power-saving settings. Technically, this watch is powered by two chipsets and two operating systems to enable this feat of battery longevity, but the user experience is very similar to that of the Galaxy Watch6 or Pixel Watch 2, just with OnePlus taking the helm on the health and fitness features. And one of its most underrated features is the charger\u2014you can plug any USB-C cord into it, so you don't have to set up a new cable somewhere. It's worth noting that this is a large watch, so consider it carefully if you have small wrists.Health capabilities are lacking\u2014there's no fall detection or electrocardiogram\u2014but there's sleep tracking, and it's generally pretty accurate. Some features, like heart-rate tracking, distance traveled, and steps, have mixed accuracy in our testing, which means you shouldn't buy this smartwatch if you're primarily using it for those functions. Otherwise, I was able to control my smart home devices via Google Home, control my music playback, respond to Slack messages, and delete those pesky emails\u2014all without having to take my phone out of my pocket. OnePlus has since unveiled a cheaper version, the OnePlus Watch 2R, but I haven't tested it yet.Comes in a 46-mm size.$300 $250 at Amazon$300 at OnePlus (Watch 2)$230 at OnePlus (Watch 2R)Photograph: AppleBest for iPhone Weekend WarriorsApple Watch Ultra 2Frequently escaping to the hills every weekend? If your activities often take you to remote areas in rough terrain, then it might be smart to pony up for the expensive, uber-durable, and gigantic Apple Watch Ultra 2 (8/10, WIRED Recommends). A bigger watch means a bigger battery\u2014we got nearly four days with normal use. The Ultra 2 has better mics than the Series 9 to pick up your voice, an 86-decibel siren to alert your position to anyone nearby, and a more precise GPS to better track your hikes (plus help you find your way back with the Backtrack feature). There's a spare customizable button on the left side called the Action Button, which you can use to trigger an activity of your choosing. It's made of titanium, and the case rises up to protect the edges of the display, which is also covered with scratch-resistant sapphire crystal.New in the Ultra 2 is the ability for the screen to hit a crazy bright 3,000 nits, which is a little overkill and really only meant for extreme situations. This smartwatch is faster, with the same new S9 chipset as the Series 9, supports Double Tap, and Siri processes basic interactions much more quickly. You can see topographic maps on the screen, but there's still no way to view offline maps without an iPhone.Comes in a 49-mm size.$780 at Amazon$799 at Apple$799 at Best BuyPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuFor Samsung LoyalistsSamsung Galaxy Watch UltraSamsung's Galaxy Watch Ultra (7/10, WIRED Review) is the company's Apple Watch Ultra and Garmin competitor, and it's a solid first entry into the world of pricey, feature-rich, and powerful smartwatches designed for professional athletes. It lasts a little over two days on a charge because it's a big 47-mm watch and can pack a beefy battery. There's a titanium case and sapphire glass face, plus it's rated to 10 ATM and IP68, so you can submerge it up to 100 meters underwater. The heart rate tracker is remarkably consistent with the Apple Watch Ultra 2, and the dual-band GPS delivers accurate mapping. The software isn't as intuitive, and a few features are lacking when compared to other performance smartwatches, but this is a good start if you're in the world of Android.Comes in a 47-mm size.$650 at Samsung$650 $600 at Amazon$650 at Best BuyPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuThe Calculator WatchCasio CA53W-1CR Calculator WatchIt's a calculator \u2026 on a watch. How much smarter can you get? Seriously, the buttons might be tiny, but you can calculate how much your tip will be when grabbing the bill at the restaurant, and everyone will marvel at your brilliance. This cheapo watch from Casio is a classic\u2014it's comfy and lightweight\u2014and you can cycle through a few modes, including a stopwatch, an alarm, and a second time zone. There's a five-year battery life, and the fully automatic calendar goes through the year 2099 (that's 15 battery changes).Comes in a 43-mm size.$25 $22 at Amazon$27 at Walmart$30 at CasioPhotograph: WithingsAn Analog-Looking SmartwatchWithings ScanWatch 2Withings' ScanWatch 2 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) can pass for an analog watch. Its health-tracking feature set is comprehensive\u2014you get heart rate monitoring, an electrocardiogram, blood oxygen measurements, and sleep tracking. Battery life is stellar too, as it can live up to 30 days with light use. (Heavier usage will see roughly 22 days before needing a charge.)The main problem is the tiny display on this watch, which is too small to read some notifications. The GPS is also connected, meaning it requires your phone to be tethered and nearby. There's an optional Health+ subscription, but we'd advise against it, as it doesn't offer much utility. The ScanWatch 2, like the Garmin Vivomove Trend, doesn't have the rich features and apps you'll find on the likes of an Apple Watch, but if you just want to monitor your health data\u2014and you don't want your watch to look too techy\u2014this will do the job.Comes in 42-mm or 38-mm sizes.$350 at Best Buy$350 at WithingsPhotograph: CasioBest Barely Smart WatchCasio ProTrek PRW-61I had this Casio on my wrist for more than a month and used one of its handful of functions every single day, something I can't say for many smartwatches. I used the stopwatch to track my rest intervals between sets at the gym. I set my world time to New Delhi, India, the time zone my sister is in. I've used the compass to navigate when I emerge from the subway in New York City and can't get my bearings, and I've learned to read the barometer\u2014mostly just to see how cool it is to predict the weather without having to ask a voice assistant.I love how this watch looks. It's rugged and outdoorsy, but still relatively classy. Even better, it's incredibly comfortable to wear. Seriously, I never took it off in the month I tested it. It's been fine in the shower and through workouts. I love that it's made of biomass plastics from regenerative resources, such as castor seeds and corn. Don't let that worry you about durability; I've been through a move, dinging it on various walls, and got paint on it, and yet it looks pristine. The dial is easy to read\u2014the indices glow or you can press a button right below the case to light 'em all up for nighttime visibility. And you never need to recharge it. Casio\u2019s Tough Solar tech means it recharges itself via sunlight.Comes in a 47.4-mm size.$319 at Amazon$229 at Walmart$252 at CasioPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuOther Watches Worth ConsideringHonorable MentionsThe number of smartwatches on the market is staggering. I\u2019ve tested models from Tag Heuer, Citizen, Montblanc, and many other fashion brands, but most of them are simply too expensive for what you get. Here are a few options I like.Samsung Galaxy Watch6 and Watch6 Classic for $200 and $279: Why not save some cash and buy last year's smartwatches from Samsung? The Galaxy Watch6 series came in multiple flavors (7/10, WIRED Recommends), as in you could choose from two sizes in the standard version and two sizes in the Classic model, which featured a mechanical rotating bezel to scroll through the interface. Just remember that while these work with any Android phone, only Samsung phone owners can enjoy electrocardiograms and irregular heart rate alerts. The larger size Classic lasted two full days for me, and a day and a half with the always-on display.Mobvoi Ticwatch Pro 5 Enduro for $350: A smartwatch\u2019s design is important. You have to enjoy wearing it! Unfortunately, I feel absolutely nothing with Mobvoi's latest watch; the Enduro is just plain boring. That's a shame because it's a solid Wear OS watch that's snappy and can deliver a whopping four days of battery life on a single charge thanks to the company's clever dual-display technology (it uses a low-power panel for the always-on screen, and an OLED for when you start interacting with it). The other problem? This watch runs Wear OS 3.5, whereas the latest version is Wear OS 4. Mobvoi has a spotty track record in issuing updates to its devices in a timely fashion, and I don't expect that to change here.Apple Watch Series 8 for $307: If you can find the 2022 Apple Watch Series 8 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) for a good deal less than the Series 9 (under $300), you should snag it. It's nearly identical to the latest model, especially the health features. Save your cash!Photograph: MontblancAvoid These SmartwatchesNo ThanksNot every smartwatch is a winner. Here are a few ones we've tried that aren't worth the dough.Fossil Smartwatches: Fossil has officially exited the smartwatch business, yet it still sells many on its storefront. I highly recommend you skip those models as they will not get many updates (if any).Montblanc Summit 3 for $1,270: This is a beautiful (and large) smartwatch, and it runs Wear OS 3, but that doesn't mean it's worth the high price. There's no speaker, no Google Assistant, and the fitness features feel half-baked. It just doesn't offer all that much other than a pretty face.Photograph: Natalya Trofimchuk/Getty ImagesSwap Your StrapsFresh BandYou don't need to stick with the strap you get in the box! Nearly every smartwatch these days has straps that can easily be swapped out. Apple Watches and Google's Pixel Watch have a proprietary strap system, but analog watch straps will work for others, making your options nearly endless. All you need to do is figure out the strap size of your smartwatch. You can usually find this on the back of the strap itself (you'll see \u201c20 mm\u201d or just \u201c22\u201d), or you can check the manual or the website you purchased the watch from. It's an easy way to further match your timepiece to your look.Photograph: FitbitFitness Trackers vs. SmartwatchesWhat's the Difference?If you don't see an option here, you might have better luck in our Best Fitness Trackers guide. It depends on what you are looking for. Smartwatches typically replicate many of the functions found in your smartphone via apps\u2014you can control smart home functions, start conversations via WhatsApp, respond to Slack messages, and call up smart assistants like Siri or Google Assistant to ask almost anything. This is in conjunction with the standard health and fitness tracking features, plus a more familiar touchscreen interface. However, the downside is the battery life typically lasts a day or two, if not a little more.Fitness trackers, on the other hand, aren't as feature-rich. You typically won't be able to access many other apps. Yes, there's the ability to read emails and texts, control music playback, or even access tap-to-pay features, but you're generally much more restricted. The screens are often smaller, but they deliver the same if not better health- and fitness-tracking capabilities (depending on the model) than smartwatches. Battery life is where fitness trackers win out, typically lasting days if not a week. If battery life and fitness and health are top of mind, get a fitness tracker. But if you want rich notifications, the ability to respond to them, and the option to access apps without having to pull out your phone, a smartwatch is the better pick.Julian Chokkattu is a senior reviews editor at WIRED, and has been covering personal technology and reviewing consumer products for nearly a decade.

Here's how to choose the right one for you. Written by Matthew Miller, Contributing Writer July 31, 2024 at 12:49 PM PDT Reviewed by Alison DeNisco Rayome Why you can trust ZDNET 33 years of experience 30 hands-on product reviewers 10,000 square feet of lab space What to Consider + - Primary smartphone Start by looking at the phone in your hand. If you own an iPhone, then you can consider an Apple Watch, or a watch running an operating system that is not powered by Google's Wear OS. If you own an Android smartphone, forget about buying an Apple Watch, as they do not even work with an iPad or Apple computer, let alone your Android. Android users can consider Google Wear OS watches, as well as those running a real-time operating system like Amazfit offers. + - Price Most smartwatches are priced in the $250 to $400 range, so there is not a lot of variance in price, especially if you use your smartwatch daily and want a reliable watch. Apple offers the high-end Apple Watch Ultra 2, while there are some specialized Google Wear OS and Garmin watches that can cost more than $1,000. + - Battery Life Expect your smartwatch to last a full day and night, so you can track your sleep and then charge it while you get ready for work. A few new smartwatches are now easily lasting 48 hours between charging, with some pushing that another day or two so we are seeing improvements in battery life. + - Cellular connectivity While smartwatches serve as companions to our smartphones, some models support cellular connectivity. If you buy one of these then you will need a watch line with your carrier, but these are typically $10 per month. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 only comes with LTE support, but you are not required to enable cellular service. Cellular capability is great for those who want to leave their phones behind and still remain connected for communications, application usage, and safety.

And thanks to powerful sensors and extensive app suites, they've become one of the most popular health and fitness trackers, too. At ZDNET, we've tested all of the best smartwatches on the market, testing their battery life, durability, features, and more. We also interviewed athletes, fitness experts, and medical professionals to ask what features they loved most about their smartwatches to help you get a better idea of the top health and fitness tracking features, too. Also: The best Apple Watches we've tested What is the best smartwatch right now? Based on both our hands-on testing and insights from experts, we named the Apple Watch Ultra 2 the best smartwatch overall due to its new processor, long battery life, storage capacity, high-quality titanium materials, sleep-tracking capabilities, women's wellness features, and advanced workout metric feature suite. If you're not an Apple user, read on to see how watches from Samsung -- including its newest Galaxy Watch Ultra -- Google, Garmin, Withings, and Amazfit compare, to find the best smartwatch for your needs and your wrist.

The Ultra 2 builds on the Ultra with a new processor, a much brighter display, twice the storage capacity, and the use of recycled titanium materials.Also: Apple Watch Ultra 2 vs. Watch Ultra: Is it time to upgrade?The Apple Watch Ultra 2 is the most rugged and capable Apple Watch to date and offers a bright, flat 49mm display made of scratch-resistant sapphire glass and 3000 nits maximum brightness. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 is larger than the Series 9, but the titanium case helps keep the weight down, and it is far lighter than competing sports watches. Apple's WatchOS 10 launched with APIs for custom workouts and we are starting to see third parties release new versions of applications to support this advanced training functionality. We tested the TrainingPeaks integration and this capability is a serious shot across the bow of dedicated GPS sports watches.Apple Watch Ultra 2 tech specs: Display: 49mm, 410 x 502 pixels OLED sapphire glass | Battery life: 36 hours | Dimensions: 49 x 44 x 14.4mm | Weight: 61.3 g | Water/Dust resistance: 100m with IP6X | LTE cellular option: Yes Show Expert Take Show less Show less View now at AmazonView now at Best BuyView now at Apple Pros Temperature sensing for sleep and ovulation estimates Crash detection contacts first responders when you're in a crash WR50 water resistance New advanced workout metrics Cons Less than two-day battery life Apple Watch Series 9 Best smartwatch for iPhone users Released in 2023, the Series 9 model builds upon the Apple Watch legacy. Similar to the Ultra 2, the Series 9 supports a double tap gesture that allows you to control your phone by simply tapping your index finger and thumb together. With this feature, you can do everything from answering calls, snoozing your morning alarm, playing or pausing media, ending timers, and more.\\With the new Series 9, you no longer need an active connection for Siri, since the watch can now process requests without it. Not to mention, due to Crash Detection, the watch can also detect when you are involved in a car crash and will connect you to emergency services. Also: Apple Watch Series 9: Top 4 features that warrant the upgrade from Series 8Among other features, the Series 9 is excellent for daily users, and athletes looking to track their health journey. Former University of San Diego track athlete Emma Clark said she replaced her Garmin Forerunner with an Apple Watch when she retired from competition. \"For someone who lives an active lifestyle but is no longer competing competitively, it makes the most sense to have a watch integrated with important things on my phone, like my calendar and messages,\" Clark said.Apple Watch Series 9 tech specs: Display: 396 x 484 pixels OLED | Battery life: 18 hours | Dimensions: 45 x 38 x 10.7mm | Weight: 38.8 g (Al) | Water/Dust resistance: 50m with IP6X | LTE cellular option: Yes Show Expert Take Show less Show less View now at Best BuyView now at Crutchfield Pros Fitbit integration Advanced safety features Small size, extreme comfort Improved battery life Cons Limited customization of exercise details Still only one size Google Pixel Watch 2 Best Google smartwatch Google's second-generation Pixel Watch 2 improves in one key area: it has a longer battery life than the original Pixel Watch. This is achieved through a slightly larger battery capacity, but even more of this improvement is due to the modern Qualcomm processor found at the watch's core. Fitbit development includes improved stress tracking thanks partly to the cEDA measurements, stress management score, and skin temperature sensor. We also now have pace and heart rate zone alerts that can be set before the start of your exercise. Also: Google Pixel Watch 2 review: In one key area, it surpasses every other smartwatchAnother part of the stress management aspect is logging your mood and completing mindfulness sessions. I appreciate this focus on mental health as it helps me take a break during the day and evaluate my physical and emotional state. Slowing down and reflecting is always important to do.One of the best functions of the Pixel Watch 2, which even beats out the Apple Watch, is the focus on safety. The Apple Watch can appear in your Find My application, and you can share your location with family and friends, but that's a passive setting that requires people to physically check the app to find you. Google Pixel Watch 2 tech specs: Display: 320ppi AMOLED | Battery life: 24 hours with AOD | Dimensions: 41 x 41 x 12.3mm | Weight: 31 g (without band) | Water/Dust resistance: 5 ATM | LTE cellular option: Yes Show Expert Take Show less Show less View now at Amazon Pros Lightweight titanium casing Sapphire glass AMOLED display Advanced safety features Large capacity battery Google Wear OS app support Cons Large size not suitable for smaller wrists Blood pressure certification taking much longer than advertised Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra Best Samsung smartwatch for outdoor adventurers Apple took a shot across the bow of serious GPS sports watch brands with the Apple Watch Ultra series, and now Samsung joins the party with the large Galaxy Watch Ultra. Samsung branded it the same way as Apple, along with a familiar orange button and waterproof silicone band. A few other advanced features found in Apple's model are present in the Samsung model, which is a great thing for Android phone owners, especially Samsung Galaxy phone owners.The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra has a unique square design with a round watch face, an interesting magnetic lug system, three buttons on one side, gesture support, advanced running dynamics, and more. Samsung's Galaxy AI is present in the form of wellness insights that combine into a daily score to help guide you to optimal performance, including healthy sleep levels.Review: The Galaxy Watch Ultra convinced me to replace my Apple Watch in less than a week. Here's whyThe Watch Ultra runs the Samsung-powered Google Wear OS 5.0 with One UI Watch 6.0, meaning it still looks like a Samsung smartwatch, but also supports Google Assistant, Google Maps, Google Wallet, Google Play Store, and more Google apps.It has an operating system optimized for the round watch design with a virtual rotating bezel. Fall detection, messaging, phone calls, and more are available on the watch, with advanced fitness data such as VO2 Max and advanced running dynamics data also supported.At $649, it is the most expensive Samsung Galaxy watch, but it is still $150 less than Apple's competing Apple Watch Ultra 2.Galaxy Watch Ultra tech specs: Display: 1.5 inch, 480 x 480 pixels Super AMOLED | Battery life: Two to three days | Dimensions: 47.4 x 47.1 x 12.1mm | Weight: 60.5 grams | Water resistance: 10 ATM+IP68 | LTE cellular option: Yes Show Expert Take Show less Show less View now at Best BuyView now at Amazon Pros Brighter, bigger display Upgraded optical and electrical BioActive sensors New, faster Samsung Exynos processor Sapphire crystal display and small form factor Cons Large display is likely to consumer more battery power Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 Best Samsung smartwatch for smaller wrists Samsung's latest smartwatch for the masses, the Galaxy Watch 7, was unveiled along with the Galaxy Watch Ultra at its 2024 Unpacked event in Paris in July. The Watch 7 is available in two smaller sizes compared to the Watch 6 series, 44 and 40 mm, so it is likely to appeal to most Galaxy phone owners with smaller wrists. The Watch Ultra is a large 47mm watch designed for those with larger wrists. Unfortunately, this year, there is no Galaxy Watch model with a rotating bezel, so if you like this navigation method, then you will have to rely on the software option that supports moving your finger around the outside of the watch face to scroll through lists and tiles.Also: Hands-on with the Galaxy Watch 7 and Galaxy Watch UltraThe Galaxy Watch 7 is affordable at $300 for the 40mm model and $330 for the 42mm model. LTE cellular support is an additional $50, along with the cellular plan from your carrier.Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 tech specs: Display: 1.5-inch 480x480 Super AMOLED (44mm) and 1.3-inch 432x432 (40mm) | Battery life: Up to 40 hours | Dimensions: 44.4 x 44.4 x 9.7 mm (44mm) 40.4 x 40.4 x 9.7 mm (40mm) | Weight: 28.8g (44mm) and 33.8g (40mm)| Water/Dust resistance: 5ATM/IP68 | LTE cellular option: Yes Show Expert Take Show less Show less View now at Amazon Pros Gorgeous, refined hardware Excellent price for a powerful smartwatch Broad support for health and fitness features Extensive third-party application support Cons Less than two days of battery life Limited sleep details Apple Watch SE Best value Apple Watch Apple made an interesting move in 2020 and released a lower-priced Apple Watch designed to expand the use of an Apple Watch to other family members. The newest version of the Apple Watch SE starts at just $249, and if you are an iPhone user, it's an easy wearable to recommend.Emery Wright, a former ZDNET associate editor who contributed to this article, wears her Apple Watch to track her steps, check notifications, and stay mindful of how she spends her time. She said it helps her accurately track running distance and pace while she trains for her next half-marathon.With an Apple Watch, iPhone users can answer phone calls, receive notifications, and send messages from the convenience of their wrist. That's why Dr. Richard Newman, MD, Head & Neck Surgical Oncologist, prefers wearing an Apple Watch over a Garmin one during his everyday routine.Also: Apple Watch SE (2022) vs. Apple Watch SE (2020): Should you upgrade?Now retired, Newman is training for his 75th marathon. He said he appreciates the convenience of smartphone connectivity: \"For daily running, I use the Apple Watch. As a physician, sometimes I get a call, and so I like being able to answer on my watch. It also monitors my heart rate, which is nice\" he said.The next generation of the Apple Watch SE contains many features from the Apple Watch Series 8. You gain Crash Detection technology, meaning the watch can detect if you've been in an accident and contact first responders. It also features the enhanced Workout app, giving you access to custom workouts and advanced metrics like heart rate zones, stride, length, and vertical oscillation. Ultimately, the newest version of the Apple Watch SE proves great things can come in small packages. Apple Watch SE tech specs: Display: 368 x 448 pixels OLED | Battery life: 18 hours | Dimensions: 44 x 38 x 10.7mm | Weight: 36.5 g (Al) | Water resistance: 50m | LTE cellular option: Yes Show Expert Take Show less Show less View now at Garmin Pros Brilliant AMOLED display More than week long battery Exquisite design, fit, and finish Cons Expensive Garmin Venu 3S Best Garmin smartwatch alternative Garmin's watches are GPS sports watches focused on helping you improve your health, fitness, and performance. There are some features that rival smartwatches, but the Venu 3/3S is clearly the best Garmin to take on the Apple Watch and Samsung Galaxy Watch.The Venu 3/3S is extremely well built, has a brilliant AMOLED display, lasts for more than a week, lets you accept and make calls from the wrist, and supports voice assistants via a connected smartphone.In addition to its smartwatch functions, the Venu 3/3S supports all of the amazing Garmin functions and vast ecosystem. This includes subscription music support, Garmin Pay, Connect IQ app support, and the superb Garmin Connect smartphone application.Review: Garmin Venu 3SGarmin Venu 3S tech specs: Display: 390 x 390 pixels AMOLED | Battery life (GPS): 21 hours | Dimensions: 41 x 41 x 12mm | Weight: 27 grams (40 grams with band) | Water resistance: 5 ATM | LTE Cellular option: No Show Expert Take Show less Show less View now at Amazon Pros Gorgeous AMOLED display Lovely, refined design Two week battery life Low price Extensive health and wellness support Cons No Google Assistant support Overwhelming smartphone app experience Amazfit Balance Best basic, budget smartwatch One company that continues to push the limits of what you can buy for just over $200 is Amazfit. The Amazfit Balance offers an elegantly designed smartwatch with Amazon Alexa support and the ability to answer calls via a Bluetooth connection to your watch, just like all other non-cellular smartwatches. It runs the latest Zepp OS 3.0 operating system, built for a lean and mean experience.It's tough to beat the low $220 price, and I continue to push the watch to see where the flaws are that could justify such a low price, but they don't exist. The Amazfit Balance has a brilliant AMOLED display, integrated mic and speaker, GPS, various advanced health/wellness sensors, and a battery life that lasts up to two weeks between charges. The battery life alone is something modern smartwatches cannot match and if you want to charge your watch just twice a month rather than every other day, then you might want to consider this watch.Review: Why I wear this $220 smartwatch even after testing Garmin and Apple watchesAmazfit provides the Zepp smartphone application that provides an exhaustive experience to track every detail of the data captured by the various sensors. The one flaw is that the application may be overwhelming for some users and thankfully, Amazfit continues to refine and simplify the application to make it more useful for Amazfit Balance owners.Phone calls sound good and it is convenient to make and accept calls from your wrist when your phone is secured in a pocket or your backpack. There is support for more than 150 sports and the available watch faces look awesome.Amazfit Balance tech specs: Display: 1.5-inch, 480 x 480 pixels AMOLED | Battery life: 14 days | Dimensions: 46 x 46 x 10.6 mm | Weight: 35 grams (w/o strap) | Water resistance: 5 ATM | LTE Cellular option: No Show Expert Take Show less Show less View now at Best BuyView now at Crutchfield Pros Excellent battery life thanks to hybrid design Analog hands that adapt to digital display Extensive Withings ecosystem Cons Some advanced metric require a subscription Limited third-party support Withings ScanWatch 2 Best hybrid smartwatch Withings is focused on providing advanced health and wellness products with the ScanWatch series available to capture data from your wrist. The Withings ScanWatch 2 continues to provide 30 day battery life in a hybrid watch with support for Android and iOS smartphones.To navigate the watch, it's as easy as rotating the crown button through the various displays and pressing in to make selections. There is no back button, so you will need to scroll through the available screens in each widget to get to the back option on the display to return to the original main display carousel.Review: My favorite hybrid smartwatch just got smarter, and its battery life is still incredibleWith a hybrid design, the Withings ScanWatch 2 has standard analog watch hands on its face with a small OLED display that you can scroll through with the rotating crown button. The ScanWatch 2 can also perform an ECG assessment, measure blood oxygen levels, track your heart rate throughout your day, measure sleep, and track your general physical activity. One gripe that I have with the sleep tracking on the watch is that it can't distinguish between deep and REM sleep, so it's not the most informative sleep-tracking device available today.

My pick for the best smartwatch is the Apple Watch Ultra 2. It may be debatable if an iPhone is the best smartphone or not, but it is clear the Apple Watch is the wearable to beat -- especially for Apple users. The Ultra 2 is lauded by athletes and product reviewers as the best Apple Watch ever made. If you're an Android user, you may prefer a Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra -- the newest of the company's smartwatch lineup. I picked up the LTE model that provides cellular connectivity independently from my phone, but when paired with the Galaxy S24 Ultra, it's a perfect combination of elegance and power.SmartwatchPriceBattery lifeDisplay sizeApple Watch Ultra 2$79936 hours49mmApple Watch Series 9$39918 hours45mmGoogle Pixel Watch 2$35024 hours41mmSamsung Galaxy Watch Ultra$65040 hours47mmSamsung Galaxy Watch 7$30018 hours44mm and 40mmApple Watch SE$21618 hours44mmGarmin Venu 3S$45010 days41mmAmazfit Balance$22014 days46mmWithings ScanWatch 2$35030 days38 and 42mm Which is the right smartwatch for you? If you're in the Apple ecosystem, we highly recommend the Apple Watch Ultra, Apple Watch SE, or Apple Watch Series 9 due to the easy connectivity and convenience of features like Apple Pay and Apple Music.The Google Pixel Watch 2 is the prime option for Pixel owners and for those Android smartphone users who want the best available from Google. It doesn't have the battery life of a Samsung Galaxy Watch, but there are other compelling features that stand out. The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra and Watch 7 are great smartwatches built to last with stellar sensors and the ability to work with Android devices. However, finding the best smartwatch for you can be more complicated, especially if you're looking for one that fits a specific use case. Check out my expert recommendations below.Choose this smartwatch...If you need...Apple Watch Ultra 2The best, longest-lasting smartwatch with buttons to quickly launch your favorite apps or perform critical functions. It's a durable, rugged watch that can be your iPhone companion in all situations. Apple Watch Series 9A well-rounded smartwatch for fitness and communication.

Withings ScanWatch 2A hybrid watch that looks like a standard watch with analog hands, but underneath this elegant exterior is the power of the Withings health and wellness ecosystem. Factors to consider when buying a smartwatch Smartwatches serve as companions to our smartphones, and there are several things to consider as you explore the many options available to you. Several factors will help you quickly narrow down available candidates, so let's take a closer look and help you select the best smartwatch for you.Primary smartphone: Start by looking at the phone in your hand. If you own an iPhone, then you can consider an Apple Watch, or a watch running an operating system that is not powered by Google's Wear OS. If you own an Android smartphone, forget about buying an Apple Watch, as they do not even work with an iPad or Apple computer, let alone your Android. Android users can consider Google Wear OS watches, as well as those running a real-time operating system like Amazfit offers.Price: Most smartwatches are priced in the $250 to $400 range, so there is not a lot of variance in price, especially if you use your smartwatch daily and want a reliable watch. Apple offers the high-end Apple Watch Ultra 2, while there are some specialized Google Wear OS and Garmin watches that can cost more than $1,000. Battery life: Expect your smartwatch to last a full day and night, so you can track your sleep and then charge it while you get ready for work. A few new smartwatches are now easily lasting 48 hours between charging, with some pushing that another day or two so we are seeing improvements in battery life. Cellular connectivity: While smartwatches serve as companions to our smartphones, some models support cellular connectivity. If you buy one of these then you will need a watch line with your carrier, but these are typically $10 per month. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 only comes with LTE support, but you are not required to enable cellular service. Cellular capability is great for those who want to leave their phones behind and still remain connected for communications, application usage, and safety. How we test smartwatches All of the smartwatches included in this list were chosen based on how they performed when tested in the real world by the ZDNET team. When we test smartwatches, we typically follow the same routine for each one to see which performs best.Daily wear: We wear the smartwatch as our primary watch with communications, applications, and other elements being tested as if it was our only smartwatch.Application selection and performance: One aspect that makes smartwatches different than standard watches is the support for applications. We load up the watch with apps and then test the performance and functionality of those applications. Apple excels in the area of third party application support with Google's Play Store improving each year. Garmin, Amazfit, and others also are expanding the number and selection of apps available on watches.Workouts: Smartwatch makers have embraced health and fitness so we take our smartwatch out for running with GPS, rowing on the Hydrow, biking on trails, and walking with the family. GPS and heart rate data is tracked and then we evaluate the accuracy against proven GPS sports watches.Sleep and activity tracking: Sleep tracking has improved with smartwatches over time and we evaluate them as compared to smart rings and other watches. Nighttime is also a good time to charge your smartwatch, so you may choose not to use your watch to track sleep so your watch can serve faithfully all day and into the night.For a deeper look into our testing process, check out our comprehensive smartwatch testing methodology. FAQs Are there any smartwatches I should avoid? There are many reasons why a person might want a smartwatch, so depending on your needs, it's hard to recommend watches that will satisfy everyone. However, based on my testing, there are a couple of smartwatches that you may want to leave off your list of considerations as you conduct your research.Fossil has been offering smartwatches for a long time, and I still have a working Fossil Wrist PDA that is powered by Palm OS and has a tiny stylus. For the past few years, Fossil has been making Google Wear OS-powered smartwatches and offering a fairly compelling option with some unique styles. However, in January 2024 Fossil Group announced that it would no longer be releasing smartwatches, with the last Gen 6 model released in 2021. You can still find some Fossil watches available, and Fossil Group stated that they will continue to update the watches for the next few years, but be careful when you are considering one of these watches.There was a great promise with a luxury Wear OS watch in 2022 when Montblanc released the Summit 3 smartwatch. While we provided a preliminary review as we looked for a future update that was supposed to add some core functionality, that update never came, and the watch sits idly by running the same older version of Wear OS on a processor that is now a couple of generations old. It's a lovely luxury watch so if you want a basic smartwatch with those good looks, maybe you can find one on sale. How do I set up my smartwatch? Watches in our list, other than Google Wear OS or Apple Watch models, are typically set up by downloading and installing the associated companion smartphone application and then pairing the watch with that application. Some Google Wear OS watches also use this method since those models have additional applications beyond what Google provides on Pixel Watch.If you own a Google Wear OS smartwatch, primarily from Google or Samsung, then the Google Watch or Samsung Wearable application must first be installed on your Android smartphone. Google Pixel Watch models also now have Fitbit integrated into the watch, but to take advantage of this vast health/fitness ecosystem the Fitbit smartphone application is also required. Samsung also has its Samsung Health application so pairing and set up of a Google Wear OS watch is a bit of a process that generally requires two or more smartphone applications.Apple Watch users turn on the watch and then follow the prompts to pair it to an iPhone, often with the iPhone camera scanning an image that appears on the Apple Watch face. Apple has the Watch smartphone application preloaded on the iPhone so set up is quick and easy. If you had a previous Apple Watch then you can also have all of that data synced over to a new model, which makes upgrading Apple Watch models one of the experiences that keep people upgrading on a regular basis. Can you use a Samsung or Google watch with an iPhone? Google Wear OS watches used to work with both Android and iPhone devices, but the new Wear OS 4 and later watches from Samsung and Google only support Android smartphones. iPhone users should stick with the Apple Watch, while Android phone users should seriously consider a Google Pixel Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch model.Garmin, Amazfit, and Withings watches work flawlessly with both Android and iPhone devices. Can I text from a smartwatch? You absolutely can! However, most of their screens are too small to type on, so you'll compose messages with speech-to-text or other dictation functions or choose from several generic, auto-generated responses. Garmin watches support quick-response text messaging via a connected Android smartphone. Apple restricts third-party text messaging on the iPhone. Can you use a cellular Apple Watch as a standalone device? While you can leave your iPhone at home while you run, go to the store, or stroll on the beach, you must have an iPhone turned on and connected to the internet at this other location. This is one reason why connecting to an iPhone and switching to an Android makes the Apple Watch useless with an Android phone.After initial setup, a cellular-enabled Samsung Galaxy Watch can act as a stand-alone mobile device. With the latest Galaxy Watch 6 or Watch 5 Pro running Wear OS powered by Samsung, many more apps can be used on the go, so you can leave the phone behind in most cases. What are the hot new features in the latest smartwatches? Health and fitness tracking have been the areas with the most innovations and improvements in the last few years. While these watches are not medical devices, they have sensors, algorithms, and applications that help you track trends in your heart rate, stress levels, and blood oxygen levels, even allowing you to detect when ovulation occurs. You can use it as a basic ECG to check if further investigation is needed. The latest Galaxy Watch 5 can also measure your body composition; testing indicates it matches other methods reasonably well.These smartwatches can also serve as capable GPS sports watches to track the details of your outdoor activities. Exercise guidance is provided on the watch with connected health applications on your smartphone so you can keep track of your progress, too. What's the future of wearable technology? We will likely continue to see expansion of the health and wellness features in smartwatches, but what's next on the horizon for these wrist-based computing devices? With increased connectivity and widespread adoption, smartwatches will likely become more integral to our daily lives. This may include connectivity to other devices in our lives. For example, as you approach your electronic door lock, your paired smartwatch could unlock your door so you can keep both hands on your groceries or luggage when you return home. People also regularly have video calls with family and friends, not just coworkers, so future smartwatches may integrate tiny cameras so that users can communicate in this same manner while out and about.In addition, as AI continues to integrate into our lives, having this technology available in our watches should help provide data faster and more accurately than simple web search queries that we may carry out with Siri or Google Assistant. What's the best smartwatch for health monitoring? All smartwatches today integrate advanced heart rate sensors, temperature sensors, blood oxygen sensors, and more, as our health data is tracked 24/7. Samsung led the way with its smartwatch health monitoring, which includes body composition, advanced sleep tracking, ECG, blood oxygen, running power, and even blood pressure measurements.Apple has advanced its health monitoring technology, and the upcoming watchOS 11 will bring even more capability with detailed data measurements in its Vitals application. Training Load will also be coming with this next version of the operating system, challenging the likes of Garmin, Coros, and Polar with this advanced fitness metric. Can smartwatches monitor blood sugar? The FDA released a safety communication to the public that advises consumers not to use smartwatches or smart rings that claim to measure blood glucose levels without piercing the skin. That said, there are indeed FDA-authorized blood glucose level devices that attach to your body and then send that data to smartwatch applications so that you can use your smartwatch to view the readings from an approved device.Devices, like those from Dexcom, send real-time glucose data directly to a compatible watch. For Dexcom monitors, this includes most versions of the Apple Watch. Make sure to check both your glucose monitor and your smartwatch compatibility before deciding whether or not to use your smartwatch to connect to your monitor and smartphone. What about tracking blood pressure? There are a few models out there that can measure health stats like blood pressure, which are great for giving you a general idea of how your health journey is going so you can keep your doctors up-to-date with your healthcare plans. However, they're not as accurate as a blood pressure monitor, so you shouldn't rely solely on your smartwatch to monitor your heart or general health.Samsung provides blood pressure monitoring via its Galaxy Watch models in countries outside the US, with rumors that Apple may launch watches supporting this functionality in 2024. Should I choose a smartwatch based on compatibility? Eric Potter, USA weightlifting Level 1 Coach and Performance Coach at Future Fitness, encourages people to choose a smartwatch based on compatibility, recommending an Apple Watch for iPhone users and a Samsung Galaxy Watch for Android fans. He notes that both smartwatches can track steps, heart rate, and exercise, but there are also crucial differences.\"The Apple Watch has a larger interface allowing for easier viewing,\" he said. \"On the other hand, the Samsung Galaxy Watch is cheaper than the Apple Watch, and the battery life tends to last longer.\" Are there alternative smartwatches worth considering? There are many options if you're looking for a smartwatch to pair with your phone to keep up with calls and messages or track your workouts and morning jogs. Here's a short list of choices that I thought were great options. View at GarminView at Mobvoi Meet the experts ZDNET sourced external industry experts for this article.

They're now everything in one: a comprehensive health and fitness tracker, digital wallet, and an extension of your smartphone, even if your smartphone is nowhere nearby. Several smartwatches I've reviewed recently can also measure your heart rate, detect elevations, and automatically connect you to emergency services if you have a fall. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood oxygen (SpO2) readings are perks of certain models, too.That said, the best smartwatches go above and beyond, housing various features and apps while keeping up with your day-to-day needs. And of course, there's style: many smartwatches can be customized, from their straps to their faces, to fit your personality.With options from Apple, Fitbit, Garmin, Google, Samsung and more, see all of my picks for the best smartwatches below.

Apple Watch Series 9 The best smartwatch overallOur expert review: Average Amazon review:\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606SpecificationsSizes: 41mm, 45mmBattery Life (Rated): 18 hoursGPS: YesSwim-Proof: YesHeart Rate Monitor: YesLTE: OptionalMobile Payments: Apple PayCompatibility: iOSToday's Best DealsView at AmazonView at AppleView at Adorama USReasons to buy+Siri works offline+Double-tap gesture is awesome+New UWB chip helps find your phone+First carbon-neutral Apple deviceReasons to avoid-Find iPhone feature only works with iPhone 15The Apple Watch 9 is the best Apple Watch yet, and the smartwatch I myself use on a daily basis. It\u2019s not a major upgrade over the Apple Watch Series 8 in terms of features, but it does introduce some useful updates. What's new is the S9 processor, which is 25% more efficient before, powering a brighter 2,000 nit display and neat new double-tap gesture. The double-tap gesture makes it possible to navigate the watch one-handed, while a next-gen ultra-wideband chip helps you track down a misplaced iPhone more easily.Latest news Due to a patent dispute between Apple and Masimo, the Apple Watch 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 are banned from sale with the blood oxygen feature. That said, you can purchase them now and I'll update this story if that changes.What's more, the Apple Watch Series 9 is one of Apple's first carbon-neutral certified devices. Using more recycled parts, less packaging, and coming with a 82% recycled yarn Sport Loop, the Series 9 takes a big step in an eco-conscious direction. I consider these kinds of efforts in my ratings.Otherwise, the Apple Watch Series 9 is a full-featured health tracker and communications tool. With watchOS 10, this smartwatch packs the latest and greatest of what the Apple Watch experience has to offer. Whether you want a smartwatch for working out, answering calls from your wrist, or using the best Apple Watch apps, this is the best smartwatch for you. As long as you have an iPhone, of course.Read our full Apple Watch 9 review.The best Android smartwatchImage 1 of 6(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Dan Bracaglia/Tom's Guide)(Image credit: Dan Bracaglia/Tom's Guide)(Image credit: Dan Bracaglia/Tom's Guide)(Image credit: Dan Bracaglia/Tom's Guide)(Image credit: Dan Bracaglia/Tom's Guide)2.

Available in 40 and 44mm, the design of the device remains unchanged from its predecessor. However, under the hood, the Watch 7 boasts an upgraded GPS antenna with outstanding accuracy, double the storage capacity of its predecessor, and a faster, more power-efficient processor. Battery life is good for roughly 24 hours using the always-on display and 40 hours in power-save mode, which is par for the course.Sleep insights are provided after only one night of use, unlike the competition, and are detailed yet highly digestible. However, my favorite feature on the Galaxy Watch 7 has to be Samsung's near Energy Score metric, which is updated daily and takes into account sleep quality, recent workouts and more to help keep you motivated.

Google Pixel Watch 2 The best smartwatch for Pixel smartphonesOur expert review: Average Amazon review:\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606SpecificationsSizes: 41mmBattery Life (Rated): 24 hoursGPS: YesSwim-Proof: YesLTE: OptionalMobile Payments: Google WalletToday's Best DealsView at Amazon(Black)View at VerizonPreorder at Best BuyReasons to buy+Stress-detection sensor+Safety Check feature+Improved battery lifeReasons to avoid-Big bezel-No wireless chargerThe Google Pixel Watch 2 is the best smartwatch for Pixel phone users, and one of the most enjoyable watches I've worn from a reviewer's standpoint. A full collection of Google apps and fitness tracking powered by Fitbit\u2019s platform make for a compelling smartwatch. In many ways, the Pixel Watch is the best of both worlds, pairing a top-notch Wear OS experience with Fitbit\u2019s holistic health-tracking (which is further enhanced with a Fitbit Premium membership.) There are plenty of tools on-board for staying connected and getting active.But there\u2019s some room for improvement: the thick bezels and singular size option will still deter some users in terms of design. Luckily, an improved battery life compared to the original Pixel Watch makes up for it. Plus, I love the reassurance offered by the new Safety Check feature that shares your location with emergency contacts when you might need their help most.Read our full Google Pixel Watch 2 review.The best value smartwatchImage 1 of 4(Image credit: Tom's Guide)(Image credit: Tom's Guide)(Image credit: Tom's Guide)(Image credit: Tom's Guide)4. Apple Watch SE (2022) The best smartwatch value for iPhone usersOur expert review: Average Amazon review:\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606SpecificationsSizes: 40mm, 44mmBattery Life (Rated): 18 hoursGPS: YesSwim-Proof: YesHeart Rate Monitor: YesLTE: OptionalMobile Payments: Apple PayCompatibility: iOSToday's Best DealsView at AmazonView at Amazon(Silver)Reasons to buy+Lower price than previous Apple Watch SE+Color-matched bottom case+Same chipset as Apple Watch Series 8Reasons to avoid-No always-on display-The Apple Watch SE is kind of a hybrid device, pairing an older Apple Watch design with the Apple Watch Series 8's chipset. The $249 smartwatch doesn't have all the Series 8's features, but still stands out for its great fitness tracking and safety features. It also offers an LTE option, making it a good choice for those interested in trying out Family Setup.When choosing between the Apple Watch Series 8 vs. Apple Watch SE (2022), your ultimate decision will be if you want to spend an extra $150 for a brighter display with an always-on option, an ECG monitor and skin-temperature, and a bigger display. If those tools aren't deal-breakers for you, the SE is a highly capable option for iPhone users. It even gets watchOS 9, the most up-to-date Apple Watch software with low power mode, fresh new watch faces, an upgraded workout interface, a redesigned compass tool and the new Medications app.Read our full Apple Watch SE (2022) review.The best Fitbit smartwatchImage 1 of 4(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)5. Fitbit Sense 2 The best smartwatch from FitbitOur expert review: Average Amazon review:\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606SpecificationsSizes: 40mmBattery Life (Rated): 6 daysGPS: YesSwim-Proof: YesHeart Rate Monitor: YesLTE: NoMobile Payments: Fitbit Pay, Google PayCompatibility: iOS, AndroidToday's Best DealsView at Amazon(Grey)View at Walmart(Blue)View at Verizon(Blue)Reasons to buy+Proactive stress management with cEDA+Comfortable design+Robust fitness and health tracking with Fitbit PremiumsReasons to avoid-No third party appsCompared to the original Fitbit Sense, the Sense 2 features an upgraded design, interface and EDA sensor, making for Fitbit's most holistic smartwatch yet. Thanks to advanced health analysis and deep integration with Fitbit Premium, the $299 Sense 2 also sustains an edge in fitness-tracking over many of the best smartwatches on this list.An update to the stress-detecting EDA (electrodermal activity) sensor plays a large role in the device\u2019s success: now called cEDA ('c' for continuous,) the sensor monitors stress levels or heightened responses throughout the day, prompting the user to take action on mood monitoring with Body Response notifications. However, added support for Google Wallet and Google Maps, while useful upgrades, won\u2019t be available for the Fitbit Sense 2 at launch. There\u2019s oddly no third-party app support, either. Still, for a smartwatch that helps you get in touch with how you feel, the Sense 2 succeeds.Read our full Fitbit Sense 2 review.The best fitness-tracking smartwatchImage 1 of 4(Image credit: Tom's Guide)(Image credit: Tom's Guide)(Image credit: Tom's Guide)(Image credit: Tom's Guide)6.

The $449 Garmin Venu 3 maintains Garmin\u2019s reputation for thorough fitness tracking and accurate GPS, while having the smarts of mirrored notifications and an on-wrist voice assistant.Though Garmin still lacks a large third-party app store and continues to steer clear of LTE support, nap-tracking and a new sleep coach work on tracking your rest while daily summaries offer behavioral insights. An abundance of sport profiles, added Recovery Time suggestions, and on-watch interval creation keep you tuned into your activity, too. What's more with a 14-hour battery life, you rarely need to stress about keeping the Garmin Venu 3 charged.Read our full Garmin Venu 3 review.The best smartwatch for safetyImage 1 of 4(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)7.

For me personally, it's the later that stands out. In addition to excellent watchOS running features, the Ultra has an extra third button \u2014 the Action Button, which comes in handy for workouts but also serves as a quick way to access safety features, such as Emergency SOS and the Apple Watch Ultra's Siren which is a huge difference between Apple Watch Series 9 vs. Apple Watch Ultra 2.Its 49mm screen is huge while the entire watch built for adventure. The bezel is made from titanium, with a lip around the screen to add more protection. The display is made from sapphire glass, and the watch has an increased water resistance of 100m. With up to 60 hours of battery life (in low power mode), it also has the stamina to keep up with me for multiple days. It's still not the best battery life option compared to Garmin's sports watches, but it's better than any other Apple Watch.The Apple Watch Ultra is a serious smartwatch. I found it's not for everyone, but depending on your needs, it could strike the right balance.

This lightweight device gives you everything you\u2019d want in a running watch, from accurate tracking to music controls to the ability to create custom workouts, for the price of an Apple Watch. The device also offers access to Garmin\u2019s wide range of training metrics, which help you not only plan workouts but also recovery time.During testing, my colleague found the Garmin Forerunner 265's beautiful AMOLED display to be bright and easy to read, even in direct sunlight. It also has a touchscreen, which makes it easy to navigate around the watch. The battery is long enough to last through a few workouts, even with music playing. he Forerunner 265 has inherited some of the more advanced health features usually reserved for Garmin\u2019s more expensive running watches. It also now has the ability to track multisport training sessions in the triathlon mode, and Garmin's Training Readiness Score. It's a fantastic improvement on an already fantastic watch, and a great buy for all levels of runner.

Boasting the same competent BioActive sensor found in the Galaxy Watch 7, the Ultra is capable of advanced sleep and workout tracking, monitors for health anomalies like sleep apnea and irregular heartbeats, and provides valuable AI-backed insights and tips aimed at well-being.This is the longest-lasting Android smartwatch currently available, with up to 48 hours of battery life. It also boasts an eye-catching titanium finish, a customizable 'Action' button, and a bright, easy-to-view AMOLED screen that reaches 3,000 nits \u2014 the same as the Apple Watch Ultra 2 \u2014 making it easy to view even in direct sunlight.The only downsides to the Galaxy Watch Ultra are the steep $650 price and the fact that it's not meant to be worn while scuba diving or for other extreme watersports, despite 100 meters of water resistance.Read our full Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra reviewThe best smartwatch for step countingImage 1 of 4(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)10.

I will say it's not the best smartwatch for fitness tracking overall, as it struggles to provide accurate heart rate readings. But if you're looking for something that will get you moving with hourly step reminders and alerts when you've reached your daily goal, this smartwatch is a great choice.Not only that, the Versa 4 a lovely-looking smartwatch with a slim profile and sleek metallic finishes. It looks very similar to the Fitbit Sense 2, yes, but this is the better choice if you're on a tighter budget or aren't as interested in stress-tracking. The Versa 4 still has reliable sleep-tracking and other perks available via Fitbit Premium.Read our full Fitbit Versa 4 reviewHow to pick the best smartwatch for youWhen looking at the best smartwatches for you, you're somewhat limited by the smartphone you own. If you want an Apple Watch, for instance, you'll need to have an iPhone. And while Wear OS watches work with both Android and iPhones, you get far less functionality when not connected to an Android device. There are plenty of differences between Apple Watch vs. Fitbit and Apple Watch vs. Garmin as well.Samsung's smartwatches offer the greatest in terms of cross-functionality, but even here, Android phone owners will get more in terms of replies to notifications and the ability to make and receive phone calls. After that, when picking a smartwatch, you also want to get one that fits your wrist comfortably. Those with smaller wrists may find larger smartwatches \u2014 ones with case sizes larger than 44mm \u2014 to be too bulky and cumbersome to wear. If you need features like cycle or pregnancy tracking, you might find our list of the best smartwatches for women helpful, too. Similarly, you want to find a smartwatch that fits your style. Although the Apple Watch is limited to one shape, you can purchase it in different finishes. Samsung's smartwatches offer a little more choice, while Wear OS watches, which are made by a number of companies including Fossil, Tag Heuer, Diesel, and others, give you many more options when it comes to their design. Does your smartwatch come with a metal strap? Here's how to remove a link from a watch. And if you need smartwatches for certain fitness goals. see our guides to the best running watches and best GPS watches. You also might be better suited for one of the best fitness trackers instead.How we test the best smartwatchesMy team and I test every new smartwatch to gauge its design and comfort. If it\u2019s not stylish and comfortable enough to get you from an early morning workout to the office to a night out, you probably won\u2019t wear it every day. Most smartwatches are also fitness trackers, so we put all of its sensors to the test, from step counts to heart rate to GPS (when applicable).We install apps and use them to see if the device\u2019s app store is robust enough to elevate it to smartwatch status. If the watch has built-in LTE, we test cellular connectivity and call quality to make sure the device can actually stand on its own without a smartphone nearby.And we measure battery life using everyday scenarios \u2014 including workouts, using apps, and getting notifications \u2014 to make sure you can get through an entire day without needing to charge up.For more smartwatch tips, see our smartwatch buying guide.Round up of today's best dealsApple Watch Series 9 $397.99ViewSee all pricesSamsung Galaxy Watch 7 $299.99ViewSee all pricesGoogle Pixel Watch 2 $249.99ViewSee all pricesApple Watch SE (2022) $249 $199ViewSee all pricesFitbit Sense 2 $299.95 $249.95ViewSee all pricesGarmin Venu 3 $434.99ViewSee all pricesApple Watch Ultra 2 $699ViewSee all pricesGarmin Forerunner 265 $449.99 $349.99ViewSee all pricesSamsung Galaxy Watch Ultra $599.98ViewSee all pricesFitbit Versa 4 $199ViewSee all pricesWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricespowered by Sign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.

The good news is there are plenty of choices out there, whether you\u2019re team iPhone or Android. Choosing the right smartwatch depends on your budget and how you intend to use it.

Check out our full guide to buying a smartwatch for more details on what to look for, and the features you should expect at each price point. This story is part of Samsung Event, CNET's collection of news, tips and advice around Samsung's most popular products. We\u2019ve been reviewing smartwatches for about a decade and have witnessed how they\u2019ve evolved over the past 10 years. While smartwatches were once niche, expensive and clunky, today\u2019s models are well worth your dollars and attention. Read on to learn more about our top picks.What is the best smartwatch?The Apple Watch Series 9 is our favorite overall smartwatch. It has the right combination of smooth and polished software along with a wide variety of health metrics and plenty of smartphone companion features. The Apple Watch set the stage for the modern smartwatch, and the Apple Watch Series 9 takes that a step forward with useful new features like Precision Finding for locating your iPhone 15 more easily. If you\u2019re an iPhone owner, the Series 9 provides the right balance of features for the price.The Apple Watch Series 9 isn\u2019t perfect. Battery life still only lasts about one to two days, the new Double Tap feature doesn\u2019t always feel practical and the Apple Watch still lacks helpful wellness features like a sleep score and recovery metrics. We feel it has the right balance of health tracking and everyday usability to make it the best choice.Best smartwatches for 2024 Apple Apple Watch Series 9 Best smartwatch Like Faster Siri performance More precise at finding a lost iPhone Variety of health and fitness features Double Tap lets you use the watch without touching it Don't like New Double Tap gesture can feel awkward Lacks the Ultra's useful Action button No improvements to battery life Precision Finding requires iPhone 15 The Apple Watch Series 9 might not be as adventure-focused as the Apple Watch Ultra 2, but it still features a dust- and crack-resistant design, a temperature, blood oxygen and ECG sensor and comes in 41 and 45mm sizes. You can also choose a cellular or LTE model that lets you take calls and answer messages from your wrist without your phone, although that does cost extra.It has the S9 chip to support the Double Tap gesture so you can pinch your thumb and forefinger together to control the watch when you can't reach it with the other hand. Like the Ultra 2, the Series 9 also has on-device Siri and faster processing times than earlier Apple Watches. Battery life generally lasts 18 hours with typical use, less than many of its competitors. $302 at Amazon Apple Apple Watch Ultra 2 Best do-it-all watch for iPhone Like Incredibly bright screen More accurate dictation and on-device Siri 64GB storage means more space for music and apps Double Tap is very useful Don't like Battery life is the same as first Ultra Limited recovery metrics The Apple Watch Ultra 2 is Apple's best smartwatch, with a tough titanium construction and an Action button to quickly start workouts or launch apps. It has the brightest screen of any Apple Watch at a maximum of 3,000 nits which makes it incredibly easy to see when adventuring in the great outdoors. For adventurers and athletes, it also has a built-in siren for safety and a dual-band GPS for accurately tracking your route. LTE is also onboard so you can venture out without a phone and still stay connected.Although it's designed to be an outdoor watch, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is still a fantastic all-around smartwatch. Inside is the same S9 chip as found on the Apple Watch Series 9 which supports gestures like Double Tap and allows the watch to process Siri commands on-device. This means you can use Siri without being online and later in the year you'll be able to ask the voice assistant for health data. Like earlier Apple Watches, the Ultra 2 also comes with a blood oxygen sensor, electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) app, fall detection and emergency SOS. The battery also lasts at least twice as long as all other Apple Watch models. It's only compatible with the iPhone, so if you have an Android phone, you'll want to look at another option on this list. $699 at Amazon Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 and 6 Classic Best overall watch for Android Like Screen is twice as bright as last year One-click watch band design is backwards-compatible Switch phones without resetting the watch Rotating bezel is back on the Classic Don't like Need to charge the watch every day Irregular heart rhythm/ECG only for Galaxy phones Classic is $100 more than the Galaxy Watch 6 Sleep tracking accuracy is uneven Samsung's Galaxy Watch 6 is the best Android watch for most people. Both the Galaxy Watch 6 and 6 Classic have incredibly bright screens that hit a maximum of 2,000 nits, so seeing your watch in all lighting conditions is easy. All the flagship features you would expect are included: an ECG, blood oxygen, body composition and temperature sensors. Note you do need a Galaxy phone to use the ECG, but all the other features work seamlessly with other Android phones. Like the Apple Watch Series 9, you'll need to charge the Galaxy Watch 6 every day, especially if you want to track sleep.2023's Galaxy Watch 5 Pro remains in the lineup if you need the best battery life of any Galaxy Watch, lasting up to three days on a charge. $200 at Amazon $200 at Best Buy Google Pixel Watch 2 Best Android smartwatch for heart rate accuracy Like Beautiful design Accurate heart rate sensor Faster charging Good selection of health stats and workout options Don't like Battery life could be longer Some features require Fitbit Premium Only one size option Bezels are noticeable The Pixel Watch 2 is a beautiful-looking Android smartwatch with accurate heart rate tracking and health sensors like an ECG. It fills the gaps with many of the features we wanted in the first Pixel Watch, such as automatic workout detection. If you're familiar with Fitbit, the Pixel Watch 2 has a similar interface for logging workouts and viewing your health data. For runners, the watch can give you pace guidance and heart rate zone notifications.Beware that the battery isn't as strong as some other options on this list, and you will likely find yourself charging this watch every day, especially if you like to do outdoor GPS workouts and track your sleep. It does charge faster than the first Pixel Watch. It's also still available only in one 41mm size. $247 at Amazon $250 at Best Buy $250 at Crutchfield Garmin Venu 3 Best fitness watch for Android and iOS Like Comprehensive health and sleep metrics Helpful reports and insights like Body Battery and Morning Report Large screen No subscription for health metrics and reports Don't like Design doesn't feel as premium as similarly priced watches Small app ecosystem Slow app downloads Separate apps for managing health insights and watch faces No home button The Garmin Venu 3\u2019s stellar battery life, a wide selection of health tracking features and workout types and comprehensive wellness metrics make it a top choice. The battery life alone is enough to make the Garmin Venu 3 stand out, with it lasting for about a week on a single charge according to CNET\u2019s review. Of course, it isn\u2019t perfect. It doesn\u2019t feel as premium as some other watches of the same price, it doesn\u2019t have as many apps as the Apple Watch, and the software may not feel as intuitive as alternative watches from Google, Samsung or Apple. The Garmin Venu 3 makes up for that with useful wellness tools like the Body Battery, which tells you how \u201crecharged\u201d you are based on activity, sleep and other factors. Best of all, Garmin doesn\u2019t require a subscription to access such features. $450 at Garmin $440 at Amazon $440 at Best Buy Apple/Sarah Lord/CNET Apple Watch SE (2022) Best no-compromises smartwatch Like Lower price Same performance as the Series 8 Car-crash detection for additional safety Don't like No always-on display No QWERTY keyboard Most new features can be found on older watches too The Apple Watch SE retails for $250 but you can regularly find it discounted to $200 or less, which makes it an excellent choice for the budget-conscious buyer. Expect most of the same features found on more expensive Apple Watch models like the Series 9, including activity tracking, third-party apps and safety features like Emergency SOS. It does miss out on an always-on display and heart-health features like the ECG. $189 at Amazon $249 at Best Buy Factors to consider when buying a smartwatchConsider last year's model: Many new smartwatches offer incremental hardware updates over previous models, so you might want to look at the last generation's smartwatch to save some cash -- especially because software updates often bring new features to older models. For example, you could look at something like the Apple Watch Series 8 which is compatible with the latest WatchOS 10 update to get many of the same software features as the newer Series 9. Avoid buying smartwatches that are several years old, as they may start to feel sluggish. Buy at the right time of year: Smartwatches usually go on sale during Amazon Prime Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday, so it\u2019s a good idea to look out for discounts around those holidays. Knowing when new devices typically launch can also be helpful. After all, you don\u2019t want to purchase a brand new smartwatch only for it to feel out of date two months later. Samsung, Apple and Google usually release new smartwatches in the late summer and early fall time frame, but you can find more information on typical launch periods here. Look at added costs: Some smartwatches are moving toward a subscription model that unlocks certain features of your watch. Google's Pixel Watch, for example, offers a monthly $10 subscription called Fitbit Premium that offers more in-depth sleep tracking metrics, workout programs and guidance on recovery. How we test smartwatches and wearablesWe test smartwatches in the real world, focusing on key features from fitness tracking to connectivity that you'll use every day. Starting with the watch itself, we check overall performance and responsiveness. Is there any lag when navigating menus? Is the touchscreen responsive? Do apps launch quickly?Then we check if it has all the functionality you'd expect for the price. That could be everything from music playback controls to cellular connectivity so you can use the watch away from your phone or an always-on display. All smartwatches need to connect to a phone, so we also assess how easy the companion software is to navigate. The iPhone 15 mounted on a bike. Lexy Savvides/CNETDurability and designSmartwatches are something you wear on your body, so we assess how comfortable they are to wear. We also know that everyone has a different-sized wrist, so we try to see how it fits and feels on a variety of people. Then we look at how it stands up to wear and tear with daily life. Some smartwatches offer increased durability like dust resistance, or water resistance that's suited for activities like scuba diving and where possible we'll test this out for ourselves. Google Pixel Watch 2 with the charger attached vertical James Martin/CNETBattery lifeBattery life will vary depending on how you use a smartwatch, so we test battery life with a few standard tests. We see how long it generally lasts on a single charge with features that represent typical use, like the always-on display, sleep tracking and doing an outdoor workout with GPS. Fitness and health sensor accuracyWe test the accuracy of smartwatch sensors in a couple of different ways. For example, the heart rate sensor is compared against the readings taken from a chest strap, considered the gold standard in consumer heart rate tracking. We compare readings from the watch against the strap for resting heart rate, and heart rate during a variety of cardio-based activities like running or cycling. We check to see how long it takes to connect to a GPS signal when doing an outdoor workout.Other health sensors, like a blood oxygen sensor, are compared against a pulse oximeter for spot readings where possible.

See our ethics statement. Photo illustration by William Joel / The Verge Photo illustration by William Joel / The VergeAfter a long stretch of slim pickings, the last couple of years have been huge for Android smartwatches. Now there are more good options than ever. But this is still a transitional era. While we\u2019re encouraged by the stronger third-party app options, the market is still fragmented. Wear OS 4 is here for Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Watches and both versions of the Pixel Watch \u2014 and now, the OnePlus Watch 2. Wear OS 5 is here. However, the larger ecosystem is still catching up. Some features, like Google Assistant, are not yet available on certain Wear OS 3 smartwatches, and Wear OS 4 still isn\u2019t widely available. Even so, the Android wearable ecosystem is barreling ahead. Samsung just launched the Galaxy Watch FE, Galaxy Watch 7 and Galaxy Watch Ultra. Later this month, we\u2019re also expecting to see a new Pixel Watch 3.What we\u2019re looking forProcessorAndroid smartwatches have long been foiled by outdated processors. Is the chip under the hood powerful enough to run Wear OS / proprietary RTOS smoothly?EcosystemDoes a watch work better within one company\u2019s product ecosystem versus another? Will you have to buy a new watch if you switch phones?Smart featuresThese days, most wearables are capable fitness trackers. However, they\u2019re not all capable of controlling your smart home, contactless payments, or interacting with digital assistants.SupportIs this device likely to last you a while, or will you need to upgrade sooner than you\u2019d like? How communicative is the OEM about forthcoming changes?Battery lifeCan you get through the day without reaching for a charger? If not, does it support quick charging? If you\u2019d rather wait until Wear OS settles down a bit, there are platform-agnostic smartwatches and fitness watches you can buy in the meantime. Otherwise, you\u2019ll want to be aware of the chip and Wear OS version powering your watch. Mobvoi, for instance, only just started rolling out Wear OS 3 to its eligible Wear OS 2 watches. Speaking of Mobvoi, its TicWatch Pro 5 was the first to sport the new Qualcomm Snapdragon W5 Plus in the US, and while it\u2019s a great watch, you may want to wait until there are more W5 Plus watches to choose from. That said, the base W5 chip is also pretty good. The Pixel Watch 2 and OnePlus Watch 2 both sport the W5 and have notably better performance and battery life. So long as you keep the aforementioned caveats in mind, Android users have more smartwatch options than ever before. I\u2019ve rounded up my top picks, but if none of these is the right fit, you can always check out our fitness tracker guide. Best smartwatch for Samsung phonesSamsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic (43mm, Bluetooth)$330$40018% off$330$330$40018% offThe rotating bezel returns on the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic. While the updates are iterative, you now get Wear OS 4, One UI 5 Watch, larger batteries, and a larger display thanks to the 15 percent thinner bezel.$330 at Amazon$330 at Best Buy$330 at SamsungSizes: 43mm, 47mm / Weight: 77g, 85g / Battery life: Up to 30 hours with AOD, 40 without AOD / Display type: Always-on OLED / GPS: Built-in GPS / Connectivity: LTE (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: Up to 50 meters, IP68 / Music storage: 16GBIf you have a Samsung phone, you\u2019ll get the most mileage out of a Samsung smartwatch. And of the four watches Samsung has in its current lineup, I recommend the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic. Although Samsung just released the Galaxy Watch 7, there wasn\u2019t a refresh for the Classic. That means you ought to be seeing some good deals for the Classic soon, if not already. It\u2019s not often that I recommend a last-gen device, but such is my deep love for the physical rotating bezel.But, if you want the latest and greatest, the Galaxy Watch 7 offers an upgraded 3nm Exynos W1000 chip and a new 3-in-1 BioActive Sensor. It\u2019s a marginal improvement over last year\u2019s models, but I don\u2019t feel like Samsung introduced anything this year that requires having them. It also has Wear OS 5 and One UI 6 Watch, but that\u2019ll eventually make its way back to the older watches, too. Mostly, I recommend the 7 if you prefer a smaller size, don\u2019t care about the rotating bezel, and want something a smidge more futureproof. The Classic\u2019s rotating bezel is 15 percent thinner than the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic. The updated design is sleeker than its predecessor, and the larger display is easier on the eyes and is only slightly bigger at 43mm and 47mm. I have small wrists, but the 47mm was still quite comfortable for everyday wear. It\u2019s launching with Wear OS 4, which adds extended battery life, and \u2014 finally \u2014 cloud backups. One UI 5 Watch also adds some minor health and sleep tracking improvements, but this will eventually make its way to older models. While I prefer the Classic, the base Watch 6 model may be the better option if you want a smaller, lighter, sleeker, and cheaper smartwatch.The 40mm Galaxy Watch 6 and the 47mm Watch 6 Classic are iterative updates, but deliver a familiar yet elevated experience. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The VergeFor more outdoorsy folks, the $649.99 Galaxy Watch Ultra might be the more sensible choice. Of all Samsung\u2019s watches, it has the best battery life, lasting around three days in our testing. (Though, we never got the full 100-hour estimated battery life.) It\u2019s got dual-frequency GPS, a new multisport activity, an emergency siren, increased durability, 10ATM of water resistance, and a Quick Button, which acts as a customizable shortcut button. It\u2019s basically an Apple Watch Ultra for Android. Meanwhile, if you\u2019re on a budget, there\u2019s the new $199.99 Galaxy Watch FE, which is essentially a rebadged Galaxy Watch 4.Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra$650The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra is targeted at more outdoorsy folks with dual-frequency GPS, a new multisport activity, an emergency siren, and increased durability.$650 at Amazon$650 at Best BuyThe Samsung Health app also delivers a good overall fitness tracking experience, especially since you can enable turn-by-turn navigation for hiking and cycling activities. We weren\u2019t too impressed with nightly SpO2 readings, but Samsung\u2019s overall sleep tracking continues to improve. You also get built-in GPS, body composition analysis, irregular heart rate notifications, fall detection, emergency SOS features, and EKGs. Most recently, Samsung\u2019s added a new Energy score, AI-powered wellness insights, FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection, and a confusing AGEs Index metric for metabolic health. While the Energy score is broadly accurate, I found the AI-generated features to be hit or miss and the AGEs Index to be more gimmicky than useful. The latter feature is also limited to the Galaxy Watch 7 and Ultra. We don\u2019t necessarily recommend the Galaxy Watches if you don\u2019t have a Samsung phone. EKGs and sleep apnea detection require the Samsung Health Monitor app, which is limited to Samsung phones. You can work around it, but all Samsung watches work best with other Samsung devices.Read my full review of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 series.Best Android smartwatch for non-Samsung usersGoogle Pixel Watch 2 (GPS)$331$3505% off$331$331$3505% offThe Google Pixel Watch 2 now achieves a reliable 24 hours on a single charge with the always-on display enabled compared to its predecessor. It sports a new processor, multipath health sensor, Wear OS 4, and new safety features, all around a substantial update.$331 at Amazon$350 at Wellbots$331 at Best BuySizes: 41mm / Weight: 31g / Battery life: Roughly 24 hours with AOD enabled / Display type: Always-on OLED / GPS: Built-in GPS / Connectivity: LTE (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Safety Signal with Fitbit Premium / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: 32GBThe $349.99 Google Pixel Watch 2 is a significant improvement over the original. The Galaxy Watch 6 lineup will still get you a more polished overall experience, but the Pixel Watch 2 is the better choice for Android users who aren\u2019t on a Samsung smartphone.RelatedGoogle Pixel Watch 2 review: better battery, better watchThat\u2019s because of ecosystems. Some features of Samsung\u2019s watches only work with Samsung phones. Broadly speaking, the Pixel Watch doesn\u2019t care what Android phone you have; you\u2019ll get the same experience regardless. That said, its call screening feature will only work if you pair it with a Tensor-equipped Pixel phone. It\u2019s a little disappointing, but compared to Samsung, the Pixel Watch 2 doesn\u2019t gatekeep health features based on what phone you have. It\u2019s also always going to have the latest updates to Google services like Google Maps, Google Wallet, YouTube Music, and Google Assistant because, well, it\u2019s Google\u2019s smartwatch. With the Pixel Watch 2, Google also added Calendar and Gmail to its list of supported apps. Speaking of which, buying the Pixel Watch 2 will also get you a six-month trial of Fitbit Premium and a one-month trial of YouTube Music. The Pixel Watch 2 can now last a full 24 hours without needing battery-saving settings. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The VergeThe most important upgrade from last year is that the battery reliably lasts 24 hours with the always-on display enabled. Some of this is due to the more power-efficient Wear OS 4 and a new Qualcomm Snapdragon W5 processor. (It also means zippier performance overall.) It\u2019s also switched to a pin-charging system, which translates to much faster charging. You can get about 50 percent in 30 minutes, and a full charge takes about 75 minutes. Because of a firmware update, the original Pixel Watch now charges more slowly \u2014 so the difference is extra noticeable. The Pixel Watch doesn\u2019t care what Android phone you haveCompared to last year, Google has also done a better job this year of integrating Fitbit\u2019s health and fitness features. The Pixel Watch 2 now has a multipath sensor that enables 40 percent more accurate heart rate tracking for vigorous exercises. Plus, you can utilize heart rate zone and pace training \u2014 features other fitness smartwatches have had for a long time. The exercise views are also easier to read. It also now has a skin temperature sensor and the Fitbit Sense 2\u2019s continuous electrodermal activity sensor (cEDA). This means the Pixel Watch 2 is now capable of proactive stress tracking. When signs of physiological stress are detected, you\u2019ll be prompted to reflect on your mood, take a walk, or do a breathing exercise. It\u2019s imperfect, but it\u2019s one of the best implementations of mindfulness features we\u2019ve seen thus far. Safety check is a proactive timer that notifies your loved ones of your location if you fail to check in. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The VergeGoogle has also introduced new personal safety features. Safety Check is a proactive timer that will send your location to loved ones if you\u2019re in a pickle. You set an activity (i.e., taking public transportation or walking alone) and a timer duration. If you don\u2019t check in when the timer goes off, your location will automatically be shared with your emergency contacts. Another neat feature is Safety Signal. If you get an LTE watch and have a Fitbit Premium subscription, you don\u2019t need an active LTE plan in order to utilize emergency services. Speaking of safety, Google also added crash detection in a recent update and improved fall detection for bicycles. One thing to be mindful of is durability. While the domed display is beautiful, we cracked the screen on the original Pixel Watch and got deep scratches on the Pixel Watch 2. Google doesn\u2019t offer any repair options, but with the Pixel Watch 2, it has started offering its Preferred Care extended warranty, so you have more replacement options should something happen. It\u2019s not ideal since it\u2019s limited to the US and Canada, but it\u2019s a step in the right direction.We\u2019re expecting to see a new Pixel Watch 3 announced on August 13th at the Made by Google event. That means you might start seeing Pixel Watch 2 discounts in the next few weeks. If you\u2019re hoping for a bigger size, you may want to hold off, as rumor has it we could be seeing a Pixel Watch 3 XL.

While the original OnePlus Watch was horrible, this watch helps fill the void that Fossil left when it said it was pulling out of Android smartwatches \u2014 namely, a viable alternative to Google and Samsung.The 47mm case is big for petite wrists, and unfortunately, it only comes in one size, but it\u2019s made of durable stainless steel and sapphire crystal. Plus, it houses a 500mAh battery. That, plus a dual-chip architecture and novel dual OS system, results in super long battery life. How long a smartwatch lasts will of course depend on your individual usage, but I got nearly four days with normal use. That\u2019s incredible for a flagship.The OnePlus Watch 2 has stupendous battery life. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The VergeIt also has Wear OS 4, making it the only third-party Wear OS watch running the latest software. It has Google Assistant from the get-go \u2014 a big achievement since that\u2019s been a problem with other third-party Android watches. Plus, you get access to the Google Play Store for a robust app ecosystem. On the fitness side of things, OnePlus added dual-frequency GPS. That\u2019s a plus if you\u2019re outdoorsy and frequent challenging GPS environments like dense forests or crowded cities. The main things you\u2019re giving up are LTE connectivity and some features like EKGs, atrial fibrillation detection, native period tracking, and fall detection. The lack of cellular is a bummer, as it means you really should keep your phone on you when you\u2019re out and about. Still, the $300 price tag is a competitive one and may be worth the tradeoff given battery life. Read my review of the OnePlus Watch 2.Best fitness smartwatch for AndroidMobvoi TicWatch Pro 5$227$35035% off$227$227$35035% offMobvoi\u2019s long-awaited TicWatch Pro 5 has superior battery life, excellent fitness tracking, and Qualcomm\u2019s new Snapdragon W5 Plus chip.$227 at Walmart$227 at Amazon$227 at MobvoiSizes: 50mm w/24mm straps / Weight: 44.3g / Battery life: Up to 80 hours / Display type: OLED touchscreen and secondary ultra-low power display / GPS: GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, Beidou / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: 32GBMobvoi\u2019s TicWatch lineup has its devoted fans for a reason: super long battery life. The $249.99 TicWatch Pro 5 is no exception. It\u2019s got an estimated 80 hours of battery life with standard use, a secondary ultra-low power display, and a massive (for a smartwatch you wear on your wrist, at least) 628mAh battery. I didn\u2019t quite get 80 hours in my testing, but I did get a solid 48-60 hours even with heavy GPS use. That outclasses most of the watches in this category (except the OnePluS Watch 2) and is useful for backpackers and endurance athletes. It might not hold a candle to a top-of-the-line Garmin, but it\u2019s also a smarter watch for a fraction of the price.Battery life aside, the Pro 5 is a good option for fitness-focused people who aren\u2019t keen on giving up smart capabilities for a Garmin or Polar. It\u2019s also more durable. This time around, Mobvoi has also added a digital crown so you don\u2019t have to worry about scrolling through menus with sweaty fingers. The flatter side button also reduces the risk of accidental presses. The ULP display helps to extend battery life. Photo by Amelias Holowaty Krales / The VergeThe Pro 5 also has an ingenious method of displaying heart rate. When you lift up your arm, the backlight changes color depending on which heart rate zone you\u2019re in. That means you can instantly gauge whether to up the intensity or slow your roll. The Pro 5 also adds new training metrics, like VO2 Max and recovery time. The TicWatch supports stress tracking, all-day blood oxygen monitoring, fatigue assessments, as well as atrial fibrillation and irregular heartbeat detection. For outdoorsy types, it also has access to multiple GNSS systems, and there\u2019s a new barometer and compass app, as well as a one-tap measurement app that gives you a quick look at five metrics (heart rate, blood oxygen, stress, respiratory rate, and overall heart health). It\u2019s also pretty capable on the productivity front. You get contactless payments, access to the Play Store, notifications, and the ability to take calls. It\u2019s also the only Android smartwatch available in the US with the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon W5 Plus chip, which is a plus in terms of futureproofing. The only major concerns are the 50mm case that may not suit smaller wrists and the lack of a digital assistant. The good news is Mobvoi recently opened up applications for a Wear OS 4 beta program for this watch. It\u2019s not the wide upgrade rollout we perhaps hoped for, but it is a sign that Wear OS 4 is likely on the way. Read my full review of the Mobvoi TicWatch Pro 5.Best hybrid smartwatchWithings ScanWatch Light$250The Withings Scanwatch Light is a hybrid analog smartwatch that tracks the basics like steps and activities, while delivering up to 30 days of battery life.$250 at Amazon$250 at Best Buy$250 at WithingsSizes: 37mm with 18mm straps / Weight: 45g / Battery life: Up to 39 days / Display type: OLED display / GPS: Tethered GPS / Connectivity: Bluetooth / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: N/AHybrid smartwatches are an excellent way to keep things simple and subtle. The $249.95 Withings ScanWatch Light gets you the basics like push notifications, timers, and alarms. On the health front, you can track steps, sleep, menstrual cycles, and GPS workouts. (That said, GPS is tethered from your phone, not built in.) The design reminds me of a classier Swatch, particularly if you get the more colorful options in a minty green or pale blue. But the big reason the Light has dethroned our previous pick, the Garmin Vivomove Sport, is its extra-long battery life. Withings estimates it lasts up to 30 days on a single charge, and I got pretty close to that in testing with 25 days. Despite the Vivomove\u2019s more appealing $180 price tag, it only lasts about five days. The ScanWatch 2 (left) is a fancier version of the Light and has a few more health features. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The VergeIf you want a bit more out of a hybrid, you can also opt for the ScanWatch 2. It\u2019s an extra $100, but you get EKGs and atrial fibrillation detection, temperature sensors, SpO2 readings, and an altimeter for measuring elevation. It also looks a bit more elegant on the wrist, partly because of a secondary dial that tracks your daily step progress. If neither matches your style, the Vivomove Sport is still a good option that gets you access to Garmin\u2019s in-depth platform. Its Vivomove Trend is a slightly more upscale option that also supports Qi charging.

But the $449.99 Venu 3 caters to people who want top-notch fitness tracking without sacrificing productivity features. It\u2019s got a colorful and vibrant always-on OLED display and comes in two sizes: 41mm and 45mm. Like its predecessor, the Venu 2 Plus, it also has a microphone and speaker so you can take and make calls directly from the wrist. It also has a clever workaround for digital assistants \u2014 it uses Bluetooth to work with whatever assistant is already on your phone. You\u2019d think more fitness trackers would do this, but they don\u2019t. It worked well in testing, though digital assistants aren\u2019t always the smartest at understanding commands.The Venu 3 series is a little pricey, but it\u2019s the smartest watch Garmin\u2019s got to offer. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The VergeThe Venu 3 doesn\u2019t have the best third-party app ecosystem, but it has Spotify, Deezer, and Amazon Music for offline playback. Android users can also send quick responses for texts, and the watch works with either iOS or Android for folks who want to keep their options open. It also has fall detection, live tracking, and contactless payments.As for health features, it has Garmin\u2019s latest heart rate sensor, which enables its FDA-cleared EKG app to detect atrial fibrillation. Otherwise, you get built-in GPS, continuous heart rate monitoring, all of the advanced coaching features in the Garmin Connect app, and Garmin\u2019s famous in-depth health data. The Venu 3 also improves sleep tracking with nap detection and adds audio-guided meditation sessions. There\u2019s also a new wheelchair mode. This isn\u2019t the most hardcore Garmin that money can buy, but it\u2019s definitely the smartest. The price is a bit high compared to most smartwatches, but by Garmin standards, it\u2019s middle-of-the-pack.Read my Garmin Venu 3S review.Best budget Android smartwatchAmazfit GTR 4$140$20030% off$140$140$20030% offThe Amazfit GTR 4 is a platform-agnostic smartwatch that delivers a lot of bang for your buck.

I\u2019ve been consistently impressed by the GTR line of smartwatches over the years, and the $199.99 GTR 4 is no exception. Not only does it have a classic look, but you also get 14 days of battery life and a color, always-on OLED display. New to the GTR 4 is dual-band GPS \u2014 a feature that Apple and Garmin only recently introduced to their higher-end smartwatches. Or, if you like to plan your own trail runs or hikes, you can import your own GPS routes, too. It tracks 150 sports and features all-day continuous heart rate monitoring. You can also monitor stress, sleep, and SpO2 levels. For smart features, you can take calls on the wrist, and it has two digital assistants: Alexa and a proprietary offline assistant. The device also syncs with Strava and Adidas Running. The Amazfit GTR 4 is a budget option that punches above its weight. Photo by Victoria Song / The VergeThe GTR 4 isn\u2019t the best smartwatch around. Flagship watches can do everything the GTR 4 can do but in a sleeker, more polished package. However, they can\u2019t do it at this price. If price is your main priority, this gets you incredible bang for your buck. Plus, you can frequently find Amazfit devices on sale.

Learn more Smartwatches are extensions of your phone for checking notifications, making calls, and sending texts, not to mention telling the time. Ideally, the best smartwatches are also powerful tools for tracking fitness and activities and monitoring health markers. The most important things to consider when choosing a new smartwatch are the features you'll use most and your phone's operating system.Our top pick among the best smartwatches is the Apple Watch Series 9. Though it's only compatible with iOS, it's a class-leading smartwatch that offers a wide range of health and fitness tracking tools. For Android users, we recommend the Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro. It has a durable titanium design, it's an excellent smartwatch that includes a comprehensive set of health and fitness tracking features, and it has multi-day battery life.The Nothing CMF Watch Pro is a solid budget option. No smartwatch is perfect for a sub-$75 price, but the CMF Watch Pro offers the basics with a couple of premium features, like an always-on display. It's also compatible with both iOS and Android phones.

Check price at Amazon Highlights Variety of health and fitness tools Accurate GPS Interface is easy to navigate Plenty of downloadable apps New Double Tap Gesture increases its accessibility The Apple Watch Series 9 remains atop the smartwatch pack thanks to its excellent blend of health and fitness tools, smartwatch functionality, and overall effectiveness. For iOS users, there's no better wearable to buy. It's so good that it's a solid reason to stick, or even transfer, to the Apple ecosystem with an iPhone. When the Series 9 was released in September 2023, it didn't represent a massive generational leap over the prior year's release, the Apple Watch Series 8. However, it did introduce some new features that improved its accessibility, and it also debuted a fast new processor. The new additions include faster on-device Siri access, updated Smart Stack functionality, a brighter display, and, perhaps the most notable new feature, the Double Tap Gesture. The double tap gesture allows users to tap their index finger and thumb together twice to interact with the primary button of any app. For instance, it can answer or hang up a phone call, start or stop a timer, and snooze an alarm. The Apple Watch Series 9 offers the perfect blend of smartwatch features and health and fitness tracking capability, and may even sway some people to buy an iPhone in order to use it. Rick Stella/Business Insider While this new gesture is great for interacting with the Apple Watch when you have your hands full, it's a huge advancement in its accessibility. Now, users who may be unable to use the touchscreen easily can still use the watch's apps. The gesture feature and the Series 9's on-device Siri access completely change how the watch can be used. Beyond those updates, the Series 9 is still a powerful health and fitness tracker, offering several tools like sleep tracking and stress management. Its Mindfulness app also provides new mental health tools that allow users to log how they feel at certain times throughout the day. However, Apple dropped its blood-oxygen monitoring feature on all Apple Watches, including the Series 9, due to a patent dispute. The Apple Watch has long been a quality wearable, and the Series 9 continues that trend, offering something for every type of user. It delivers a premium smartwatch experience, has powerful health and fitness tracking tools, and is not only the best Apple Watch you can buy but the best smartwatch overall.Read our full Apple Watch Series 9 review. Advertisement Best budget Nothing CMF Watch Pro The CMF Watch Pro by Nothing offers a core, basic smartwatch experience along with more advanced features, like IP68 water resistance, and always-on display, taking phone calls on the watch itself, and multi-day battery life for a sub-$100 price. Check price at Amazon Highlights Incredibly affordable Take or make phone calls from the watch Multi-day battery life Core smartwatch with some advanced features For around $65, the Nothing CMF Watch Pro perfectly fits the bill for a budget smartwatch, and it works both for Android and iPhone, too. It's far from perfect, but it does have some features we're surprised to find on such a budget watch.The CMF Watch Pro focuses on the core basics of a smartwatch, including telling the time and showing your notifications. You have to dig into the CMF app's settings to pick the apps you want notifications for or select to receive all of them. You can even take a call on it thanks to its built-in microphone, which is a pleasant surprise for a watch in this price range, at least one with a recognizable brand name behind it.It also covers the basic health and fitness tracking features that most smartwatches have, like a step counter, heart rate sensor, and sleep tracking. Also surprisingly, the CMF Watch Pro supports blood-oxygen monitoring \u2014 a feature deactivated on Apple Watches thanks to a patent dispute. It also has IP68 water resistance, which means it won't get damaged with water contact, but Nothing doesn't suggest you wear it swimming. The Nothing CMF Watch Pro is incredibly affordable and works on both iPhone and Android. CMF by Nothing The CMF Watch Pro's touted 13-day battery life is also worthy of note, and I can confirm that it has multi-day battery life. We expect most people would get less than 13 days with their typical usage, but that potential range is a great plus for the CMF Watch Pro. The CMF Watch Pro also supports an always-on display, a feature Apple's Watch SE can't tout at its $249 starting price. For $65, the CMF Watch Pro lacks certain features you'd expect on more expensive smartwatches. It doesn't run third-party apps, for example. This absence may mean different things to people who need third-party apps, but for most people, it means you can't run your music streaming app and store music on the CMF Watch Pro for phone-less workouts.Watch faces are also somewhat limited, as you can't customize what widgets feature on a watch face. You can't interact with the widgets, either \u2014 tapping on them does nothing, let alone bring up the relevant app. We also found that the weather widget sometimes read \"no data\" and required us to open the CMF app for the watch to receive weather data. However, we still received notifications. While you can get notifications about text messages, the CMF Watch Pro doesn't support writing and sending texts from the watch itself, nor does it support RCS messages from Android phones, which is the modern standard that Android phones use for text messages with photos and videos. There were reports that Bluetooth connectivity between the CMF Watch Pro and your phone could be patchy, leading to missed notifications unless the CMF app was recently opened. However, it seems the latest updates addressed this, as I did not encounter issues with connectivity. So, the CMF Watch Pro isn't perfect, but it's also around $65. Considering that most good smartwatches cost over $200, downsides to the CMF Pro are fully expected, and these specific downsides are certainly acceptable for the price. Advertisement Best for Android Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro Samsung's Galaxy Watch 5 Pro is the best fitness tracker for Android users thanks to its multi-day battery life, an intuitive operating system in WearOS, and a wide variety of advanced health and fitness tracking. Check price at Amazon Check price at Best Buy Highlights Multi-day battery life Uses Samsung's unique body composition analyzer Highly accurate GPS tracking and syncing Highly durable design The Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro is a generation older than the current Galaxy Watch 6 series but has some notable advantages. Namely, it houses a larger battery that allows it to go several days before a charge. It also has a premium, durable, lightweight titanium design that caters to the active user. It's also a powerful smartwatch. Call, text, email, and app alerts are easy to interact with on the large, bright watch face, and it uses the latest iteration of Wear OS, which is fluid and intuitive to navigate. It allows for deep customization, too, including several different watch faces that can display certain relevant information. I found this one of its best features, as I could tailor what data or fitness stats it always showed on the home screen. The Galaxy Watch 5 Pro remains the top Android smartwatch overall. Rick Stella/Business Insider Health-focused users will also appreciate its variety of wellness features, including in-depth sleep tracking and a unique body composition scanner that can inform you of your body fat percentage, water weight, and BMI. These readings aren't as accurate as those you may get at the doctor's, but they're still a handy tool.For the fitness crowd, the Watch 5 Pro is stellar. Not only is there a wide range of trackable workouts, like cycling, running, and weight lifting, but there are plenty of activities that aren't specifically fitness-centric but still work out your body, like skiing and hiking. There's also a handy Track Back feature that functions like a breadcrumb feature to track your exact hiking routes; it only works for hiking and cycling, but hopefully, future updates make it available for things like trail running, too.The Watch 5 Pro isn't without its drawbacks. Some features, like the ECG function that tracks heart rhythms and blood pressure monitor, are exclusive to Samsung phones via the Samsung Health Monitor app, and they're not available on other Android phones. It's not a major red flag, but it is something to keep in mind if you don't own a Samsung phone. Even with those issues, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro is the best Android smartwatch you can buy. It's a quality health and fitness tracker and an exceptional smartwatch. For Android users, especially those who own Samsung phones, it doesn't get better than this. Read our full Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro review. Advertisement Best for Pixel users Google Pixel Watch 2 The Pixel Watch 2 is one of the best well-rounded wearables for Android users as it has a sleek, stylish design, a variety of useful smartwatch features powered by the new Wear OS 4, and reliable, accurate GPS. Check price at Amazon Check price at Best Buy Highlights Accurate and reliable activity tracking and GPS New chipset delivers faster load times and minimal lag Improved battery life Google's second iteration of the Pixel Watch, the Pixel Watch 2, addresses our main complaints from the previous model, and it easily deserves its spot as the best option for Pixel phone users. The Pixel Watch 2 continues to offer the stellar core smartwatch experience from the original Pixel Watch with the intuitive Wear OS 4 operating system, compatibility with several third-party apps, and excellent notifications and interactions with calls, texts, and emails. As an extension of your phone, it shines. The Google Pixel Watch 2 introduces major improvements and upgrades over the original. Rick Stella/Business Insider For fitness tracking, namely GPS accuracy, the Pixel Watch 2 brings major improvements, and it's actually up to par with top competing smartwatches. It includes features like sleep tracking, all-day heart rate monitoring, stress monitoring, and ECG readings. The Pixel Watch 2 also comes with a new skin temperature sensor and a new heart rate sensor, contributing to unique insights into sleep quality. We should note that some features like advanced sleep data, advanced stress management tools, and Fitbit's unique Daily Readiness feature are locked behind Fitbit's $10/month Premium subscription service. You get a free six-month trial of the service when you buy the Pixel Watch 2, which lets you decide whether it's worth keeping. The Pixel Watch 2 also shows notable improvements in battery life over the original. It gets us through a full day with activity and workout tracking while leaving enough battery for sleep tracking.Read our full Google Pixel Watch 2 review. Advertisement Best for fitness Garmin Epix Pro (Gen 2) The Epix Pro Gen 2 from Garmin does it all for a high-end price: It tracks a variety of activities, has a weeklong battery life, and offers highly accurate GPS. Check price at Amazon Check price at Garmin Highlights Tracks a wide variety of activities Extremely accurate GPS Stress monitoring In-depth sleep tracking Downloadable maps for offline use Working recommendations Week-long battery life There aren't many things the Garmin Epix Pro Gen 2 can't do. From its endless number of trackable activities and weeklong battery to its accurate GPS tracking, no-frills but useful notification system, and a suite of health-tracking features, it's more than just a quality fitness tracker; it's the best fitness tracker. Period.But since we're talking about smartwatches, it's worth pointing out it excels at that, too. Its call, text, and app notifications are on the basic end of the smartwatch spectrum, but they're still easy to interact with, and the watch still serves as a reliable extension of your smartphone. It may not have all the bells and whistles of something like the Series 9 or Watch 5 Pro, but it gets the job done. Plus, its number of extras makes it an especially great pick for fitness-focused folks or anyone who enjoys spending time outside. It offers in-depth activity tracking for things like running, cycling, weight training, and snowboarding and does more than just track heart rate and time. It can log actual workout reps and track actual ground you cover via GPS while providing a detailed route map. Garmin's Epix Pro Gen 2 is the top fitness tracking watch thanks to a wide variety of trackable activities, battery life that lasts up to a week, and one of the most accurate GPS we've tested. Rick Stella/Business Insider It's also a comprehensive health tracker with in-depth sleep and stress monitoring and a handy recovery tool that adjusts how much rest it recommends you need based on your daily activity. I found the recovery feature quite useful, especially when I wanted to push myself but decided to take it easy based on the watch's recommendation, knowing I wouldn't be at my best. This input ultimately changed how I worked out each week, and I started to feel far better on a week-to-week basis in terms of soreness and my overall recovery timeline. This feature only scratches the surface of what the Epix Pro Gen 2 can do, too, as the watch literally learns your day-to-day behavior and adapts to suit you best with workout recommendations, managing stress levels, when to go to bed and wake up, and how often you should have a rigorous workout. The fact that it does all this while also being a reliable smartwatch makes it one of the premier wearables you can buy. Advertisement Best premium Apple Watch Apple Watch Ultra 2 The Ultra 2 is Apple's biggest smartwatch that features the highly useful Action Button, has multi-day battery life, and has a rugged design that's perfect for athletes. Check price at Amazon Highlights Multi-day battery life Durable, rugged design Gig watch face Uses the unique Action button Advanced features for cyclists and divers The Apple Watch Ultra 2 offers a similar smartwatch experience to the Series 9 at a steeper price tag that reflects its exclusive high-end features. While it may not be the preferred choice for casual users, it's worth the extra investment for advanced athletes or those who spend time outdoors.It's Apple's best high-end wearable, mainly due to the features and internal hardware tailored to tracking activities like cycling, diving, and climbing. These features include a brighter screen that can be more easily seen in high-lighting conditions, tracking compatibility for freediving, scuba diving, and wakeboarding, and improved altitude readings.The Ultra 2 also features a bulkier, more durable design than the Series 9 and a battery that lasts upwards of two full days instead of needing to be recharged daily. The increased battery life is a huge improvement compared to the Series 9 (and other smartwatches in this guide) since less time on the charger means more time using it for how it's intended. The Apple Watch Ultra is as premium as Apple Watches get. It features a larger, durable design, multi-day battery life, and unique features geared toward advanced athletes. Rick Stella/Business Insider However, my favorite feature of the Ultra 2 is its Action Button, which can be programmed to open several different apps, including the fitness-tracking app, the stopwatch, or the shortcuts app. The Action Button is especially helpful for activities because, instead of starting after a short three-second countdown, like on the Series 9, it allows you to press the button once you're situated and ready to go, which also helps to sync GPS. Other notable features include the new double-tap gesture, which debuted on the Series 9, and faster on-device Siri access. It also has the new S9 processor chip and the updated ultra-wideband chip that improves its location accuracy.Although the Ultra 2 offers many features geared toward the advanced athlete, it's still a quality wearable for the casual user. It has the same health and fitness tracking tools as the Series 9 while offering similar smartwatch functionality.Note that Apple disabled the blood-oxygen monitoring feature on all Apple Watches, including the Ultra 2, due to a patent dispute.Read our full Apple Watch Ultra 2 review. Advertisement Best sleep tracker Fitbit Sense 2 Fitbit's Sense 2 combines the brand's advanced health and fitness features with decent smartwatch capability, unique sleep tracking, and a clean design reminiscent of the Apple Watch. Check price at Amazon Check price at Walmart Check price at Best Buy Highlights Lightweight design Comfortable band Long battery life All-day stress tracking Lots of trackable activities Wide variety of health insights In-depth sleep tracking For a smartwatch that excels as a reliable sleep tracker, Fitbit's Sense 2 is at the front of the pack. Not only does it track your sleep each night and provide in-depth data, but it also offers unique recommendations on improving your rest via several metrics. Plenty of wearables try to provide this level of insight, but the Sense 2 does it best.What sets the Sense 2 apart is how comprehensive the data it provides is. For example, after a night of sleep, the Fitbit app displays metrics showing how well I rested. These include time spent in REM, deep, and light sleep, as well as other factors like time spent awake, how restless I might have been, and what my heart rate was. The Fitbit app can then recommend ways to improve my sleep to better my nightly score. These recommendations may include certain workouts, when to work out, or how to keep a consistent sleep schedule. Once I got the hang of using the recommendations, they made a noticeable difference. The Fitbit Sense 2 is Fitbit's best wearable overall as it offers premium smartwatch capability and a suite of health and fitness tracking tools. Rick Stella/Business Insider It's worth noting that to make the most of the Sense 2's sleep tracking abilities, you'll need Fitbit Premium, the subscription part of the Fitbit app. Memberships run for $10/month or $80/year and are worth the expenditure for those intent on using the extra data. Fitbit Premium also provides a unique Daily Readiness Score that analyzes your prior day's activity and rest and creates a numbered score to represent how hard to push yourself. There are also in-depth health insights, like heart rate variability, available to subscribers. Aside from its capability as a sleep tracker, the Sense 2 is also an excellent fitness tracker. It tracks various activities like running, cycling, and strength training. Also, it uses a skin temperature sensor, has heart rhythm (ECG) readings, and debuted Fitbit's real-time stress tracker. The stress tracker is especially useful for its feedback on how to lower stress throughout the day.While the Fitbit Sense 2 is one of the best smartwatches, the actual smartwatch experience leaves a little to be desired. Yes, it gets notifications like calls, texts, and app updates, but the fact that Fitbit removed third-party app support and Google Assistant access is disappointing. There's also no way to store or play music via the watch.However, I wouldn't view these as deal-breakers for the Sense 2, especially if you're looking for a smartwatch with premium sleep tracking. It's one of the best Fitbits you can buy, and while it isn't an exceptional smartwatch, it gets the job done when needed while offering a suite of advanced health and wellness features. Read our full Fitbit Sense 2 review. Advertisement Best with bezel Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic Samsung's latest smartwatch, the Watch 6 Classic, brings back the rotating bezel from the Watch 4 line, and it makes navigating the excellent Wear OS 4 operating system that much smoother and easier. Check price at Amazon Check price at Best Buy Check price at Samsung Highlights Rotating bezel makes navigating the watch's interface and menus easier than the touchscreen Battery life lasts longer than a single day Large watch face that doesn't feel too big Lightweight design that's good for workouts and sleep tracking Robust smartwatch experience Plenty of health tracking features Samsung's Galaxy Watch line has offered some of the best Android smartwatches you can buy for years, and the Samsung Watch 6 Classic is no exception.One of the best additions Samsung introduced on the Watch 6 Classic was to reintroduce the rotating bezel last seen in the Watch 4 (an ideal budget option for Android users looking for something a little more premium than the CMF Watch Pro). With the rotating bezel, navigating the watch's interface and menus is fluid and easy, especially during workouts or when wearing gloves. The touchscreen isn't necessarily hard to navigate, but sometimes it took a little longer to respond to a screen swipe than it would if I just simply spun the dial.The watch's improved battery life is also a welcome update. Aside from the Watch 5 Pro, most Galaxy Watches need to find their way to a charger at least once daily to recharge, which isn't a dealbreaker, as even our top pick, the Apple Watch Series 9, requires the same daily charging. Samsung's latest Galaxy Watch, the Watch 6 Classic, sees the return of a rotating bezel that some may find easier to use than the touchscreen native to the Watch 5 Pro and Watch 6. Rick Stella/Business Insider However, having a watch with a battery that lasts more than one day ensures you can squeeze all the functionality out of it. You can use it as a smartwatch and fitness tracker during the day and as a sleep tracker at night. The Watch 6 Classic's longer battery allowed me to do that during my time with it. Not all Watch 6 users will make use of every bell and whistle, but even casual wearers will find plenty to utilize. Aside from the available activities and sleep tracking, there's a stress tracker, a heart rhythm reader (ECG), a body composition analyzer, a temperature sensor, and a cycle tracker.The highlight of these is the body composition analyzer, which I used to chart my body fat percentage and muscle mass, and the stress tracker, which tracked my specific stress levels at different times throughout the day and suggested ways to lower them. I also just really enjoyed wearing the Watch 6 Classic. Its comfortable, lightweight design felt equally good to wear while working out and sleeping as it did while sitting at my desk. The watch looks good on the wrist, too, featuring a classic round watch face design that looks and feels premium. I could see it being slightly too big for folks with smaller wrists, though it was the perfect size on my arm (and I like larger watch faces). But do keep this in mind if you don't like big watch faces.My lone nitpick with the Watch 6 Classic is that it's not all that different from the previous generation of Watch 5. It runs the latest Wear OS, which can also be downloaded on the Watch 5. What this means, though, is that upgrading to the Watch 6 Classic is best done by those wearing the Watch 4 or older \u2014 and Watch 5 users can take a beat and wait for the release of next year's Watch 7 or later.Read our full Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic review. Advertisement What to look for in a smartwatch You should consider several key factors to pick the right smartwatch for your needs. Rick Stella/Business Insider It's important to know how you intend to use a smartwatch before you start shopping for one. Maybe you want a wearable with a smaller watch face or prefer a certain strap material. You may even want one that offers robust health and fitness tracking capabilities.Here's what to consider before purchasing:Use case: While all smartwatches offer similar functionality of telling time and displaying various call, text, email, and app notifications, some are better suited to certain uses than others. For example, the Fitbit Sense 2 excels as a sleep tracker in addition to being a reliable smartwatch. If you don't need sleep tracking, the Sense 2 may not be a good fit. While most smartwatches track activities, they're not all full-fledged fitness trackers. Dedicated fitness trackers provide a variety of trackable activities and often provide in-depth progress-tracking data, monitor rest and recovery, and create workout recommendations. For information on these, check out our guide on the best fitness trackers. Sizing: Smartwatches come in a variety of sizing options, both in terms of the actual watch face and the watch strap it comes with. While some folks may benefit from a larger watch face and prefer the amount of data they can see on it, others may find big watches too cumbersome and prefer something smaller and sleeker. Compatibility: While iPhone users shouldn't buy an Android smartwatch, and vice versa, there are other compatibilities to keep in mind when shopping. For instance, some wearables, like Samsung's Watch 5 Pro and Watch 6 Classic, function better on a Samsung-branded phone than on other Android devices like Google's Pixel phones. Some features aren't available, and the overall experience is slightly different.Battery life: Battery life is one of the most important considerations when shopping for a smartwatch and directly impacts how you use it. For instance, the Apple Watch Series 9, our pick for the best smartwatch overall, requires daily charging. This pattern is fine for folks who can put it on the charger each night but may not suffice for those who travel frequently or who may not have access to a portable charger. Advertisement How we test smartwatches We test smartwatches in daily use and across standard criteria. Rick Stella/Insider Each smartwatch included in this guide went through various tests to determine how well it performed across these four categories: Features, fit & comfort, ease of use, and value. Here's how each category specifically factored into the decision process:Features: This is one of the most important considerations for any smartwatch and separates something like the Apple Watch Series 8 from something that didn't make our guide, like the Fitbit Versa 4. A wearable with features like third-party app support, the ability to play or store music, and others like sleep tracking or an always-on display truly fits the bill of being a quality smartwatch. Fit & comfort: If a smartwatch is uncomfortable, you'll be far less likely to want to wear it very often. And since a smartwatch is supposed to be a suitable extension of your phone, track your daily activity, and monitor your sleep, you need to wear it a lot. We took into consideration how the watch band feels, how lightweight it is while wearing at night, and whether it stays comfortable while commuting, working out, etc. Ease of use: Learning curve is another important factor since knowing how to get the most out of your smartwatch without fumbling through menus is vital to the experience. There will be a learning period with any new smartwatch, but the ones that are intuitive and easy to navigate from the jump are the ones that stick out. The Apple Watch Series 9 is one of the easiest watches to navigate, which is part of why it's our top overall pick. Value: Value can often be subjective and is influenced entirely by how a user utilizes a certain smartwatch. For instance, not everyone needs the Apple Watch Ultra 2. Athletes or those who spend a lot of time outside who also need a powerful smartwatch will get a lot of value out of it, while someone who is just casually active may not need all the bells and whistles. But value is still an important aspect we considered because smartwatches aren't cheap and you want to ensure that your investment is a wise one.FAQs Advertisement What is the best smartwatch?The best smartwatch largely hinges on two things: how you intend to use the smartwatch and, perhaps most importantly, which smartphone you have. For instance, the best Apple Watches only work on iOS devices, while the best Android smartwatches only work on Android devices.So, while we think the Apple Watch Series 9 is the best overall smartwatch, regardless of smartphone operating system, it's still only usable by one group of users: those with an iOS device.Consider how you intend to use the smartwatch, too. If you want something that accurately tracks activities and has several health-tracking tools, a pure smartwatch likely isn't going to be the \"best\" for you. Similarly, if you want the best pure smartwatch experience, a dedicated fitness tracker won't be the best fit. Advertisement Do all smartwatches work on any smartphone? No. Some smartwatches work exclusively on a certain operating system. For instance, the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 only work on iOS devices, while wearables such as the Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro and Google Pixel Watch 2 only work on Android devices. However, many wearables work on iOS and Android, including the Garmin Epix, the Fitbit Sense 2, and the Fitbit Versa 3. Always cross-reference which operating system a certain smartwatch requires with your smartphone's operating system before purchasing. Advertisement Can you use an Apple Watch with an Android smartphone? No, the Apple Watch is only compatible with devices running iOS. While you can still wear an Apple Watch if you own an Android phone, you won't be able to get anywhere near the full functionality out of it, like accessing any tracked data or downloading apps. Unlike smartwatches from Garmin and Fitbit, which work with iOS and Android devices, the Apple Watch only works with iOS devices. Advertisement Can you use an Android smartwatch with an iPhone?No, Android smartwatches, such as the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, Watch 5 Pro, and Google's Pixel Watches, are only compatible with devices running the Android operating system. Those with iOS devices should avoid purchasing these watches to ensure their smartwatch's full functionality.
