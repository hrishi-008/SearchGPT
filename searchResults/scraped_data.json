Jim Steinfeldt/Michael Ochs Archives/GettyImages The induction of Radiohead into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame could be perceived as a monumental moment in the preservation of the band\u2019s legacy, or a waste of time, as frontman Thom Yorke seems to believe by shrugging off the ceremony on Friday night (Mar. 29). Yet the honor is, at the very least, an occasion to reflect on what the British quintet has achieved over the course of its quarter-century-plus career, using a pissed-off debut hit single as a springboard to explore the limits of alternative rock, then shift in focus to MIDI-powered electronica, then shake up the modern album distribution model and finally release one of its best-loved live songs on its most recent album. Explore Explore Radiohead See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news Related 12 Best Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Performances of All Time 03/26/2019 Trending on Billboard Because Radiohead has released nine albums, and has never catered to radio to the point of having a large collection of immediately recognizable singles, it may be hard for an unfamiliar listener to know where to start. The following 15 songs provide a starter\u2019s guide for the band\u2019s major eras and most memorable moments, from fan favorites to essential hits, from the songs everyone loves to the ones only true \u2018Heads consider indispensable \u2014 and yes, one non-Radiohead song is included here, too. \u201cCreep\u201d (from 1993\u2019s Pablo Honey) Two things about \u201cCreep\u201d remain undebatable: Radiohead effectively transcended its monster debut single, to avoid one-hit-wonder status and sustain a hall of fame-worthy career; and, nevertheless, \u201cCreep\u201d still rules. The international smash hasn\u2019t been uplifted by Yorke and co. and their career has progressed \u2014 they went years and multiple tours without playing it live before finally bringing it back to their set lists in 2016 \u2014 but the simmering obsession that boils over into a full-throated howl would make this an enduring alt-rock artifact from the early \u201890s, even if Radiohead hadn\u2019t followed their debut with multiple classic albums. \u201cFake Plastic Trees\u201d (from 1995\u2019s The Bends) \u201cYearning\u201d is a word that pops up a bunch in critical writing on \u201cFake Plastic Trees,\u201d and it\u2019s easy to hear why: the way Yorke\u2019s syllables are stretched to their breaking points throughout the song makes it clear he\u2019s reaching for some sort of peace that\u2019s just out of his grasp. The single from The Bends is a prime example of how the songs on that album were able to add dimension to the band\u2019s sound following 1993\u2019s Pablo Honey, and marry their more sentimental impulses with layered instrumentation (here, a mix of organ, strings and acoustic strumming). \u201cStreet Spirit (Fade Out)\u201d (from 1995\u2019s The Bends) No shots at \u201cThe Tourist,\u201d \u201cMotion Picture Soundtrack\u201d or \u201cVideotape,\u201d but \u201cStreet Spirit\u201d remains Radiohead\u2019s most effective album closer to date. A ticking guitar-rock single that pulls back into a woozy sway, Yorke sings about \u201ccracked eggs\u201d and the \u201cbeady eyes\u201d of death before concluding the band\u2019s first beloved album with the refrain, \u201cImmerse your soul in love.\u201d For a group that would eventually be playing arenas around the world, \u201cStreet Spirit\u201d demonstrated that Radiohead could toss out a more nuanced type of anthem, along with sing-alongs like \u201cFake Plastic Trees\u201d and \u201cHigh And Dry.\u201d \u201cParanoid Android\u201d (from 1997\u2019s OK Computer) If not Radiohead\u2019s biggest hit, perhaps their best-loved song: the six-and-a-half minutes of \u201cParanoid Android\u201d contains three distinct sections, tethered together by a pleading urgency in which Yorke lashes out at his unnamed opposition in between distorted guitar screeches and dead-eyed harmonies. The comparisons to \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d were inevitable, but whereas Queen\u2019s song suite bursts with melodic joy, the moody \u201cParanoid Android\u201d is full of anxiety and lacks any obvious hooks, making its crossover success (it became a No. 3 hit in the U.K., still the band\u2019s biggest to date) all the more unlikely. Regardless, the second track on OK Computer showcased that album\u2019s ambition, and the band\u2019s refusal to safely abide within the tropes of alternative rock. \u201cKarma Police\u201d (from 1997\u2019s OK Computer) The only Radiohead song to appear on a Now That\u2019s What I Call Music! compilation in the U.S., \u201cKarma Police\u201d stands as one of the band\u2019s biggest alternative radio hits, and one of the reasons the critically lauded OK Computer was able to cross over to mainstream rock fans. The song\u2019s verse-chorus structure and abundant vocal hooks certainly make it more accessible than most of the band\u2019s singles, although there\u2019s still an Orwellian sense of dread \u2014 magnified by Yorke\u2019s wailing outro, \u201cFor a minute there/I lost myself, I lost myself,\u201d as the cacophony grows \u2014 that makes this a uniquely Radiohead hit. For all the brilliance of OK Computer, the album would have been missing its gateway to the masses if \u201cKarma Police\u201d wasn\u2019t positioned as its centerpiece. \u201cLet Down\u201d (from 1997\u2019s OK Computer) There are other songs on OK Computer worth highlighting \u2014 the opening rush of \u201cAirbag,\u201d the searing balladry of \u201cExit Music (For a Film),\u201d the bleary-eyed beauty of \u201cNo Surprises\u201d \u2014 but there are few moments in Radiohead\u2019s vast catalog more powerful than the bridge of \u201cLet Down,\u201d in which a disaffected Yorke raises his arms and quivers toward a feeling of hope through the cynicism: \u201cFloor collapsing, falling/ Bouncing back and one day, I am gonna grow wings.\u201d Meanwhile, the guitar interplay between Johnny Greenwood and Ed O\u2019Brien is stunningly crisp, and builds to a crowd-pleasing catharsis that Radiohead has rarely embraced since. \u201cEverything In Its Right Place\u201d (from 2000\u2019s Kid A) It took about three seconds for Radiohead fans to realize how drastic a departure 2000\u2019s Kid A was going to be from the guitar-driven alternative music of OK Computer, as album opener \u201cEverything In Its Right Place\u201d starts with a thick clump of synthesizer and proceeds to feature Yorke\u2019s disembodied, highly processed voice looped on top. Taken as the literal beginning of a new era for the band in 2000, \u201cEverything In Its Right Place\u201d served as a stunning rebuke of everything that made Radiohead a world-conquering group in the 1990s \u2014 but removed from its context, remains hypnotic, ghostly and a mean groove, especially when performed live. \u201cIdioteque\u201d (from 2000\u2019s Kid A) Speaking of grooves, the drum-machine smashes on \u201cIdioteque\u201d \u2014 the most immediately satisfying song on the famously uncommercial (but still Billboard 200-topping) Kid A \u2014 serve as the foundation of this frantic doomsday dance that remains the album\u2019s most cohesive fusion of experimental electronic music and traditional rock song structure. The yawning four-chord phrase was actually borrowed from a piece by computer music pioneer Paul Lansky, and Yorke has said that he came up with some of the lyrical yelps \u2014 \u201cIce age coming,\u201d \u201cFirst of the children\u201d \u2014 by literally pulling phrases out of a hat. \u201cPyramid Song\u201d (from 2001\u2019s Amnesiac) Recorded during the same sessions as Kid A and released just seven months after its more polished predecessor, Amnesiac was always doomed to suffer from little-brother syndrome within Radiohead\u2019s discography. However, the set very likely contains the most jaw-droopingly beautiful track on either album in \u201cPyramid Song,\u201d a cracked piano ballad that blossoms to include a haunting string section, performed by the Orchestra of St. John\u2019s in England. Although most of Amnesiac has fallen away from Radiohead\u2019s recent set lists, \u201cPyramid Song\u201d endures as a daring instrumental experiment and showcase for Yorke\u2019s melancholy vocals. \u201cThere, There\u201d (from 2003\u2019s Hail to the Thief) Similar to Amnesiac, Radiohead\u2019s 2003 album Hail to the Thief is largely considered one of the band\u2019s lesser works; at the very least, it\u2019s one of their most unwieldy, with acoustic lullabies, folk riffs, tape loops, and choral chants sprawled across its 14 tracks. Lead single \u201cThere There\u201d is where the band\u2019s prodding alt-rock congeals and nears the dazzling highs of OK Computer, however: Colin Greenwood\u2019s bass guides the action forward, the harmonies unfurl during the second verse and Yorke\u2019s hook, \u201cJust \u2018cause you feel it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s there,\u201d works as a universal cry. This is Radiohead at its showiest, and it\u2019s one of the most important songs to understanding their appeal. \u201cAtoms For Peace\u201d (from 2006\u2019s The Eraser) This is cheating a little, as \u201cAtoms For Peace\u201d is not a Radiohead song but a Thom Yorke track from his solo debut, 2006\u2019s The Eraser. Yet the album, recorded during one of the group\u2019s breaks, is a worthwhile exploration of Yorke\u2019s electronic predilections and political leanings (like Hail to the Thief, the album is critical of the George W. Bush administration and War on Terror). The sparse, jittery \u201cAtoms For Peace\u201d finds Yorke at his most emotionally bare; its title is a reference to an Eisenhower speech on atomic warfare, and later became the name of a short-lived supergroup featuring Yorke, Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich and Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea, among others. \u201c15 Step\u201d (from 2007\u2019s In Rainbows) For many Radiohead fans, listening to In Rainbows album opener \u201c15 Step\u201d for the first time took place following one of the group\u2019s biggest surprises to date: They announced a new album one week before its release in October 2007, and a pay-what-you-want online model that was unheard of at the time. Hearing Yorke\u2019s falsetto on \u201c15 Step\u201d after opting to pay a penny, or less, made for a revelatory moment; today, the song still stands as one of their more successful marriages of electronic and rock music \u2014 programmed beats percolating next to workmanlike guitar riffs \u2014 and a preview of the fleshed-out album to follow. \u201cReckoner\u201d (from 2007\u2019s In Rainbows) \u201cReckoner\u201d is not flashy, especially when compared to In Rainbows rockers like \u201cBodysnatchers\u201d and \u201cJigsaw Falling Into Place.\u201d It\u2019s elliptical, with a structure that\u2019s evident only when really paying attention to the slight flare-ups that comprise the chorus. Yet \u201cReckoner\u201d has become a Radiohead fan favorite because of its shuddering beauty, as Yorke\u2019s voice and backing falsettos seamlessly blend into the icy clanging of the percussion and the coda\u2019s restrained string section. Although the band has used a wall-of-sound approach to vocals in the past, \u201cReckoner\u201d may be their most artful harmonizing to date. \u201cLotus Flower\u201d (from 2011\u2019s The King of Limbs) The highlight of the band\u2019s muted The King of Limbs, \u201cLotus Flower\u201d is forever tied to its black-and-white music video, in which Yorke is shown dancing spastically by himself, to the point in which memes were inevitable. Although it heralds the band\u2019s least-acclaimed album \u2014 when its eight tracks were released in early 2011, fans wondered in vain whether it was really part one of a two-part release \u2014 the song\u2019s spiked bass line has made it a commanding moment in Radiohead\u2019s live show, even if Yorke\u2019s body movements are often more reserved than the music video during performances. \u201cTrue Love Waits\u201d (from 2016\u2019s A Moon Shaped Pool) Think of \u201cTrue Love Waits\u201d as a sonic password to the Radiohead Fan Club: if you only think of it as the final song on 2016\u2019s A Moon Shaped Pool, and not a beloved composition that the band has been performing since the mid-90s and released on a live album in 2001 before finally, properly recording 15 years later, you\u2019re probably not getting in. The reason why diehards adore \u201cTrue Love Waits\u201d? It really is that powerful of a statement on devotion and the way in which love endures as we evolve, or try not to in order to preserve it. The live version is acoustic, the studio version is electronic, and both are essential to understanding one of Radiohead\u2019s biggest bits of folklore.

They did a full-on New York media assault, appearing on Saturday Night Live, the Colbert Report and Late Night With Jimmy Fallon, in addition to two shows at Roseland Ballroom. With all the attention surrounding the group, we figured this was a good time to ask our readers to vote for their favorite songs by the band. You guys came out in big numbers, and selected some deep cuts that'll probably surprise some people. Click through to see the results. By Andy Greene 10. \u2018How To Disappear Completely\u2019 Absolutely everybody loves it now, but when Kid A came out back in 2000, some people weren't blown away. People expected another guitar album like their 1990s records, but Radiohead was clearly on a different path. (Nowadays, Kid A sounds like Aqualung next to some of Radiohead's more recent efforts.) The saddest song on the record is \"How To Disappear Completely,\" which was inspired by a comment from Thom Yorke's friend Michael Stipe. The R.E.M. frontman told him that the best way to deal with the pressures of touring is to say to yourself, \"I'm not here, this isn't happening\u2026\" 9. \u2018Reckoner\u2019 Radiohead spent an unusually long period of time tinkering with \"Reckoner.\" The song was first heard live in 2001, though at the time it was called \"Being Pulled Apart By Horses.\" A stripped down version popped up at later shows, though it wasn't until the release of In Rainbows in 2008 that it was finally recorded. It was worth the wait. It's one of the highlights of the album and even better when they play it live. Also, check out Gnarls Barkley's cover of the song. 8. \u2018There There\u2019 The first single from 2003's Hail To The Thief has also become a live favorite over the past decade, though it requires three-fifths of the band to be on drum duty in order to properly pull it off. Radiohead haven't gotten much radio play in recent years, but this one does occasionally pop up. 7. \u2018Let Down\u2019 OK Computer hit a lot of people by surprise when it hit shelves in the summer of 1997. People paying attention knew the band were more than just the group that did \"Creep,\" but few were prepared for the creative leap they had taken in the short time since The Bends came out just two years earlier. In an album full of classics it's easy to overlook \"Let Down,\" but its haunting beauty certainly earns it a ranking very high on any list of their finest songs. \"Andy Warhol once said that he could enjoy his own boredom,\" multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood said. \"'Let Down' is about that. It's the transit-zone feeling. You're in a space, you are collecting all these impressions, but it all seems so vacant. You don't have control over the earth anymore. You feel very distant from all these thousands of people that are also walking there.\" 6. \u2018Street Spirit (Fade Out)\u2019 This stand-out track on The Bends was a clear sign that Radiohead were maturing at a very dramatic pace. This is one of the few songs from the old days that they regularly play in concert, and one of the darkest tunes in their catalog. \"All of our saddest songs have somewhere in them at least a glimmer of resolve,\" Thom Yorke has said. \"'Street Spirit' has no resolve . . . It is the dark tunnel without the light at the end. It represents all tragic emotion that is so hurtful that the sound of that melody is its only definition.\" 5. \u2018Everything In Its Right Place\u2019 The kick-off track to Kid A was a clear sign to fans that this wasn't going to be Ok Computer II. The guitar is no longer the dominant instrument. It's been replaced by Yorke's piano work. In fact, he wrote this song on a baby grand immediately after buying the instrument. The lyrics were inspired by an experience he had after a U.K. show in 1997. \"I sat in the dressing room and couldn't speak,\" Yorke told Rolling Stone. \"I actually couldn't speak. People were saying, 'You all right?' I knew people were speaking to me. But I couldn't hear them. And I couldn't talk. I'd just so had enough. And I was bored with saying I'd had enough. I was beyond that.\" 4. \u2018Karma Police\u2019 \"Karma Police\" began as an inside joke with Radiohead around the time that they toured with Alanis Morissette in the summer of 1996. When somebody in the band acted like a dick, someone would warn them that the Karma Police were coming after them. An early version of the song was premiered on that tour, but they finished it in the studio when the tour wrapped up. The track was a single on OK Computer and it got them a fair amount of play on alternative radio at the time. 3. \u2018Fake Plastic Trees\u2019 They'll never admit it now, but many people first heard \"Fake Plastic Trees\" in the movie Clueless. It's in the scene where Cher comes home and finds her step-brother (and future boyfriend) Josh in her house. It's playing on the radio. \"Yuk! Uh, the maudlin music of the university station,\" she says. \"What is it about college and cry-baby music?\" It's definitely a cry-baby song, especially the acoustic version used in the film, but it's also one of Radiohead's most anthemic songs. The first notes of it are guaranteed to send any crowd at a Radiohead show into absolute hysterics. 2. \u2018Creep\u2019 When \"Creep\" hit MTV in 1993, Radiohead seemed destined to be another One Hit Wonder alt-rock band. At best, they'd wind up like Better Than Ezra and \"Creep\" would be their \"Good.\" The band had a dislike for the song from pretty early on (those famous guitar scratches are Jonny Greenwood trying to mess up what he thought was a boring song) and they even wrote \"My Iron Lung\" about how much they hated playing the song over and over again during their early days. After OK Computer broke big they pretty much stopped playing it, though it started to pop up on setlists a lot over the past five or so years. Yorke says it's been so long that the song almost feels like a cover song at this point. They even started opening with the song on their 2009 tour, guaranteeing that fans wouldn't drive them crazy by yelling for it all night. 1. \u2018Paranoid Android\u2019 If you had to play somebody one Radiohead song to convince them of the band's brilliance, it should probably be \"Paranoid Android.\" Over the period of six minutes it showcases the beautiful quiet textures, and the arena-rock ready bombast the band is capable of achieving. It also inspired hipsters to work around New York with T-shirts that just say \"Gucci Little Piggy.\" The track began as three separate songs, but drawing inspiration from the Beatles' \"Happiness Is A Warm Gun,\" they just combined them all together. In a bold move, they released it as the first single from OK Computer, and refused to cut it down for radio. It still managed to get some airplay. Yorke has said it's about the fall of the Roman Empire, but good luck finding anything in the lyrics that seem related to that topic in any way.

It doesn\u2019t matter that Radiohead followed up the 1993 hit with several other major and (more often than not) minor hits including \u201cKarma Police\u201d, \u201cHigh and Dry\u201d and \u201cThere There\u201d. It doesn\u2019t matter that their 1997 album OK Computer is one of the most acclaimed albums of their \u201890s. It also doesn\u2019t matter that both Rolling Stone and Pitchfork named their 2000 album Kid A as the best album of the \u201800s. They\u2019re still the \u201cCreep\u201d band. Maybe that\u2019s not a bad thing. Despite Radiohead (and their fans) distancing themselves from the song for years, it\u2019s a legitimate banger. It remains an excellent max-volume sing-along. That\u2019s the rub with bands like Radiohead. Their Mount Rushmore songs tend to overshadow a catalog full of fantastic, lesser-known tunes. The Radiohead well runs deep. Some of these were released as single B-sides or on EPs. Others were simply overshadowed on studio albums. Let\u2019s go beyond \u201cCreep\u201d and \u201cKarma Police\u201d and \u201cNo Surprises\u201d to look at some less-appreciated Radiohead songs. \"Lurgee\" (Pablo Honey, 1993) \"Lurgee\" has the unfortunate distinction of being the least streamed song (according to Spotify) on Radiohead's least regarded album. Although Pablo Honey has gained a growing number of defenders in recent years, it will always be remembered as the \"Radiohead before they were really Radiohead\" album. Buried toward the end is the beautiful, wistful \"Lurgee\". It manages to sound both like the band\u2019s shoegaze influences and its The Bends future. \u201cSulk\u201d (The Bends, 1995) Like \"Lurgee\", \"Sulk\" is both the penultimate and least streamed song on its album. The Bends features many songs in which Thom Yorke's vocals soar, but he really lets loose here. While it is ultimately a pretty simple song, Colin Greenwood's bass is the song's understated driving force. \u201cLift\u201d (OK Computer OKNOTOK, 1996) Thom Yorke's music is highly emotional while rarely feeling very personal. Listeners seldom get a look behind the curtain. For that reason, when he refers to himself by name\u2014\"You've been stuck in a lift. We've been trying to reach you, Thom\"\u2014it is one of the most transparent and moving moments in the band's catalog. \"Lift\" had the potential to be a Brit-pop smash\u2014 conventional alt-rock with a booming chorus\u2014which is probably why they shelved it for nearly 21 years. Nevertheless, it gained a following among fans as a bootleg favorite. \u201cPalo Alto\u201d (B-side, \u201cNo Surprises\u201d single, 1998) A few years before swapping their guitars for theremins and homemade computers, Radiohead showed that they were capable of simply being a damn good crunchy rock 'n' roll outfit. They point their dreary English disposition at sunny California with \"Palo Alto\". Despite Radiohead\u2019s reputation as a studio band, this is a song built to be played live, with raucous and uncharacteristic swagger. \u201cCuttooth\u201d (B-side,\u201cKnives Out\u201d single, 2001) \"Cuttooth\" isn't one of Radiohead's finer lesser-known songs. It's one of their best. Period. The perfect words to describe it are ones rarely used for Radiohead: Lively. Exciting. Fun. Released in 2001, it points an arrow toward the more dance-oriented music that the band and its members will explore in years to come. \u201cWorrywort\u201d (Amnesiac, 2001) Existing somewhere between Bjork and \u201880s ambient, \u201cWorrywort\u201d is a lovely, romantic song filled with blips and bloops. This might be the band's strongest evidence that they could lean heavily into digitally-created music without losing its soul and beauty. Habitually ahead of its time, Radiohead may have inadvertently invented chillwave with this. \"Like Spinning Plates (Live)\u201d (B-side, \u201cI Might Be Wrong\u201d single, 2001) The studio Amnesiac version of \u201cLike Spinning Plates\u201d is a beautiful if self-indulgent electronic dirge. The live version stripped away all of the backmasking and distractions to reinvent the song as a piano ballad. The original is fine, but it gets bogged down in excess. By letting its melody shine, the simple version becomes the superior one. \"A Wolf at the Door\u201d (Hail To The Thief, 2003) Calling a song with 26 million Spotify plays \u201clesser known\u201d is admittedly a bit of a stretch, but this should be considered a top-tier Radiohead song. Their albums tend to end with a romantic moment of catharsis. Hail To The Thief, to say the least, does not. It\u2019s a musical haunted house with one of Yorke\u2019s most unusual vocal performances, a thumping speak/sing that borders on rapping. It\u2019s a killer that explodes before petering out. \"Give Up The Ghost\" (The King of Limbs, 2011) While The King of Limbs is often regarded as Radiohead\u2019s most forgettable album, \u201cGive Up The Ghost\u201d rises above its surroundings. Bare, layered, and lush, it samples Yorke\u2019s vocals to create a haunting, repetitive background that the rest of the song sits on top of. \"Decks Dark\" (A Moon Shaped Pool, 2016) For all of the \u201couter space electro-paranoia\u201d reputation that the band has\u2014and \u201cDecks Dark\u201d itself directly references \u201ca spacecraft blocking out the sky\u201d\u2014Radiohead has a handful of tunes that just groove. \u201cDecks Dark\u201d starts with a twinking, fairytale piano before the band drops into a stellar, jangly jam.

But it was their ability to expand their sound and experiment with different genres and styles that has turned them into a band that continues to be critically and commercially successful today. For this list, we've chosen our entries based on a combination of the artist's fan favorites and their most commercially successful songs. Join WatchMojo.com as we count down the top 10 Radiohead songs. Special thanks to our users liamguitarmandwyer15, Alex Lefebvre and yannickwolfe for submitting the idea on our Suggest Page at WatchMojo.comsuggest They\u2019re so very special. Welcome to WatchMojo.com, and today we are counting down the top 10 Radiohead songs. For this list, we\u2019ve chosen our entries based on a combination of the artist\u2019s fan favorites and their most commercially successful songs. #10: \u201cIdioteque\u201d Kid A (2000) It may not have been released as a single, but this five-minute track continues to be a fan and critic favorite. Why? By mixing elements of electronica and intelligent dance music with frontman Thom Yorke\u2019s abstract lyrics, Radiohead gave \u201cIdioteque\u201d a doomsday feel that makes it unique among the band\u2019s work and music in general. It\u2019s since become a live staple. #9: \u201cNo Surprises\u201d OK Computer (1997) Despite its title, OK Computer\u2019s third single is actually quite surprising. With its dream pop flavors, Ed O\u2019Brien\u2019s crystal-clear guitar sound, Jonny Greenwood\u2019s glockenspiel and Yorke\u2019s soft-spoken vocals, \u201cNo Surprises\u201d is a more complex and layered track than it initially appears to be. The top 5 UK hit was also accompanied by a memorable music video with Yorke\u2019s head being slowly submerged in water. #8: \u201cCreep\u201d Pablo Honey (1993) Mainstream audiences were introduced to Radiohead\u2019s alternative rock sound with their first-ever single in the early 1990s. Taken off their debut album Pablo Honey, \u201cCreep\u201d follows the alternating sound dynamics characterizing grunge music; but took several months before it really caught on with radio and the music charts. Despite being briefly removed from their live shows, it remains one of the band\u2019s most famous tunes. #7: \u201cThere There\u201d Hail to the Thief (2003) Taken off the band\u2019s sixth studio effort, \u201cThere There\u201d was inspired by the experimental sound of a German band called Can. Though guitar dominates the track, what makes Hail to the Thief\u2019s first single really stand out are the different layers of drums and percussion featured throughout. The song made it to the UK Top 5 and is often included in the band\u2019s live sets. #6: \u201cLet Down\u201d OK Computer (1997) Though Radiohead\u2019s third album is full of sonic gems, this 5-minute number is an excellent example of the band\u2019s musical chemistry at its finest. Thanks to its complex guitar, some electric piano, melodic bass lines and plaintive but poignant vocals, \u201cLet Down\u201d is a truly highlight. Despite not being released as a single, it\u2019s since become a fan favorite. It\u2019s just that good. #5: \u201cFake Plastic Trees\u201d The Bends (1995) Inspired by the fake plastic trees of London\u2019s Canary Wharf, Radiohead crafted this moody guitar track for their sophomore effort. While still categorized as alt-rock, \u201cFake Plastic Trees\u201d started to bring the band away from their association with the grunge movement and into the realm of a more mainstream sound. But it\u2019s the way it takes us on an emotional journey through song that lands it on our list. #4: \u201cEverything In Its Right Place\u201d Kid A (2000) This Kid A track may not have any guitar, piano or drums, but Radiohead still managed to ensure that everything is in its right place. With eerie vocal effects, the use of a drum machine and electric piano, this over-4-minute cut knows just how to create an atmosphere that\u2019s creepy enough to keep you captivated. The number hasn\u2019t only been critically acclaimed but is also notable for the band\u2019s trance-inspired onstage performances. #3: \u201cKarma Police\u201d OK Computer (1997) It may not have a traditional chorus but thanks to Yorke\u2019s unique but evocative vocals, sweeping piano and guitar and a haunting melody, \u201cKarma Police\u201d is a big part of why OK Computer is so great. Well-received by critics, the 4-minute-plus track was also a top 10 smash in the UK and helped Radiohead cement their place as one of rock\u2019s finest bands.

Thanks to Ed O\u2019Brien\u2019s steady guitar playing, \u201cStreet Spirit\u201d\u2019s slow and weird melody remains implanted in our brains. We also can\u2019t help but feel Yorke\u2019s desperation as a result of his expressive vocals. In short, it\u2019s simple, beautiful and unforgettable. Meanwhile, its black-and-white music video perfectly encapsulated the song\u2019s mood. Honorable Mentions \u201cTrue Love Waits\u201d I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings EP (2001) \u201cMy Iron Lung\u201d My Iron Lung EP (1994) \u201cReckoner\u201d In Rainbows (2008) \u201cHigh and Dry\u201d The Bends (1995) \u201cPyramid Song\u201d Amnesiac (2001) #1: \u201cParanoid Android\u201d OK Computer (1997) Taking a cue from fellow Brits like The Beatles and Queen, Radiohead crafted this OK Computer single with several different musical sections. With its dark humor and mix of alternative and progressive rock, \u201cParanoid Android\u201d is often cited as one of the band\u2019s best songs. The almost 6-and-a-half minute cut further solidified its status in pop culture and rock history with the vivid color and twisted visuals of its animated music video. Do you agree with our list?

KolderieJohn LeckieNigel GodrichRadioheadRadiohead chronology Radiohead Box Set(2007) Radiohead: The Best Of(2008) In Rainbows \u2013 From the Basement(2008) Radiohead: The Best Of is a greatest hits album by the English rock band Radiohead. It was released on 2 June 2008 by Parlophone Records in the UK and by Capitol Records in the US, subsidiaries of EMI. It contains songs from Radiohead's first six albums, recorded while they were under contract with EMI. The Best Of debuted at number four on the UK Albums Chart and received mostly positive reviews. Radiohead had no creative input and were critical of the release. Release[edit] See also: In Rainbows \u00a7 Dispute with EMIRadiohead recorded their first six albums under contract with EMI. In 2007, after Radiohead chose not to renew their contract, EMI released The Best Of and a box set of Radiohead albums to boost their revenue.[1] Radiohead had no creative input into the releases and were reportedly \"enraged\", seeing best-of compilations as typical of artists in commercial and creative decline.[1] The singer, Thom Yorke, said:There's nothing we can do about it. The work is really public property now anyway... It's a wasted opportunity in that if we'd been behind it, and we wanted to do it, then it might have been good ... And now it's like when you move house \u2013 you don't want to peer through the window and see what they've done with the wallpaper because it will only upset you.[2] In 2016, Radiohead's back catalogue was transferred to XL Recordings.[3] The Best Of and the \"special editions\" of Radiohead albums, issued by EMI in the same year without Radiohead's approval, were removed from streaming services.[3][4] Content[edit] The standard edition of The Best Of contains 17 tracks from Radiohead's first six albums.[5] The special edition contains a second CD with 13 additional tracks, including the B-side \"Talk Show Host\" and the live track \"True Love Waits\", from I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings (2001).[6] A DVD compilation with 21 music videos, including nine never before released on DVD, was also released.[7] Reception[edit] Professional ratingsReview scoresSourceRatingAllMusic[8]NME(8/10)[9]Pitchfork(4/10)[6]Rolling Stone[10]The Times[11] Radiohead: The Best Of debuted at number four on the UK Albums Chart and received generally positive reviews.[citation needed] The Pitchfork critic Scott Plagenhoef praised the songs, but felt the compilation was unnecessary as Radiohead did not have a \"winding, difficult discography to navigate\". He wrote that the standard edition contained too many songs from their 90s albums The Bends and OK Computer, and that the expanded special edition missed an opportunity to collect B-sides or rarities.[6] Track listing[edit] All songs written by Radiohead (Colin Greenwood, Ed O'Brien, Jonny Greenwood, Philip Selway, and Thom Yorke), except where noted.

After their somewhat inauspicious first LP, Pablo Honey, they almost immediately took a significant turn with the My Iron Lung EP, which arrived six months before their second album, The Bends, a watershed work that merely hinted at what was to come.After OK Computer arrived in 1997, Radiohead were heralded as alt-rock's answer to Pink Floyd \u2013 a headphones band whose records gained more depth and relevance the more you listened to them. And like the earlier British band, this newer group of British art-rockers made album-length works that were meant to be taken in all at once.That made pulling individual songs out for the below list tough at times. So many of Radiohead's now classic LPs \u2013 from OK Computer to Kid A to In Rainbows \u2013 gain much more resonance as entire pieces, as lyrical and musical themes weave their way in and out of the tracks.Still, there are favorites. The band's massive legion of fans will tell you that; so do the group's set lists, which lean heavily on a core collection of tracks. Let our list of the Best Song From Every Radiohead Album serve as a guide. But dig deeper for even more and richer rewards.Next: Revisiting Radiohead's 'Hail to the Thief'Filed Under: RadioheadCategories: Best Song From Every Album, Galleries, Lists, Original FeaturesMore From Ultimate Classic RockRadiohead Music Added to Rerelease of Horror Classic \u2018Nosferatu\u2019Radiohead Music Added to Rerelease of Horror Classic \u2018Nosferatu\u2019Pretenders Team Up With Radiohead\u2019s Jonny Greenwood for \u2018I Think About You Daily\u2019Pretenders Team Up With Radiohead\u2019s Jonny Greenwood for \u2018I Think About You Daily\u201930 Years Ago: Why Radiohead\u2019s \u2018Creep\u2019 Was Initially a Failure30 Years Ago: Why Radiohead\u2019s \u2018Creep\u2019 Was Initially a FailureEd O\u2019Brien Uncertain Over Radiohead\u2019s FutureEd O\u2019Brien Uncertain Over Radiohead\u2019s FutureRadiohead\u2019s \u2018OK Computer': The Story Behind Every SongRadiohead\u2019s \u2018OK Computer': The Story Behind Every SongRadiohead Slow Down on \u2018The Tourist\u2019Radiohead Slow Down on \u2018The Tourist\u2019How a Random Soundcheck Moment Led to Radiohead\u2019s \u2018Lucky\u2019How a Random Soundcheck Moment Led to Radiohead\u2019s \u2018Lucky\u2019Radiohead Mix Louis Armstrong and Beach Boys on \u2018No Surprises\u2019Radiohead Mix Louis Armstrong and Beach Boys on \u2018No Surprises\u2019Radiohead Uses a String Section to Go \u2018Climbing Up the Walls\u2019Radiohead Uses a String Section to Go \u2018Climbing Up the Walls\u2019InformationAdvertise with UsTermsContest RulesPrivacy PolicyAccessibility StatementExercise My Data RightsDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContactFollow UsVisit us on InstagramVisit us on YoutubeVisit us on FacebookVisit us on Twitter2024 Ultimate Classic Rock, Townsquare Media, Inc.
